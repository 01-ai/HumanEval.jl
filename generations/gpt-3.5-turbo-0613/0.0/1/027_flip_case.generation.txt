Here is the implementation of the `flip_case` function in Julia:

```julia
function flip_case(s::String)::String
    flipped = ""
    for c in s
        if islower(c)
            flipped *= uppercase(c)
        elseif isupper(c)
            flipped *= lowercase(c)
        else
            flipped *= c
        end
    end
    return flipped
end
```

This function iterates over each character in the input string `s`. If the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase using the `uppercase` function. If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase using the `lowercase` function. If the character is neither lowercase nor uppercase, it leaves it unchanged. The flipped characters are then concatenated to the `flipped` string. Finally, the `flipped` string is returned as the result.
