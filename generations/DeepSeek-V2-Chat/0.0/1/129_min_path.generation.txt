To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is suitable for this problem because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that we find the lexicographically smallest path first.

Here's the step-by-step implementation in Julia:

1. **Define the function signature**: The function `min_path` takes a grid and an integer `k`.
2. **Initialize the BFS queue**: Start from all possible cells in the grid.
3. **Explore all possible moves**: For each cell, explore its neighbors (up, down, left, right) and keep track of the path.
4. **Check for path length**: Ensure that the path length does not exceed `k`.
5. **Compare paths lexicographically**: Keep track of the smallest path found.

Here's the complete implementation:

```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    n = length(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    queue = [(i, j, [grid[i][j]]) for i in 1:n for j in 1:n]
    min_path = nothing

    while !isempty(queue)
        x, y, path = popfirst!(queue)
        if length(path) == k
            if min_path === nothing || path < min_path
                min_path = path
            end
            continue
        end

        for (dx, dy) in directions
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 1 <= nx <= n && 1 <= ny <= n
                new_path = vcat(path, grid[nx][ny])
                push!(queue, (nx, ny, new_path))
            end
        end
    end

    return min_path
end
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the size of the grid.
   - `directions` contains the possible moves (right, down, left, up).
   - `queue` is initialized with all starting positions and their corresponding paths.

2. **BFS Loop**:
   - Pop the first element from the queue.
   - If the path length equals `k`, compare it with the current minimum path and update if necessary.
   - Otherwise, explore all possible moves from the current cell and add the new paths to the queue.

3. **Return the minimum path**: After exploring all possible paths, return the lexicographically smallest path of length `k`.

This approach ensures that we find the minimum path efficiently by leveraging the properties of BFS.
