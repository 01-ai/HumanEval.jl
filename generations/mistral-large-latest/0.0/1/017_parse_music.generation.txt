Sure, here is the Julia function that implements the parsing of the music string as per your requirements:

```julia
function parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}
    beat_values = Dict('o' => 4, 'o|' => 2, '.|' => 1)
    beats = Vector{Int}()

    for note in split(music_string)
        if haskey(beat_values, note[1])
            push!(beats, beat_values[note[1]])
        else
            error("Invalid note: $note")
        end
    end

    return beats
end
```

This function works by first defining a dictionary that maps each note to its corresponding number of beats. It then splits the input string into individual notes and iterates over them. For each note, it checks if it exists in the dictionary and if so, adds its corresponding number of beats to the result vector. If a note is not found in the dictionary, an error is thrown.
