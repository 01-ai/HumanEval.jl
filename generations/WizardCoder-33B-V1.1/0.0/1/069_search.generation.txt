Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector)::Int
    counts = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for num in numbers
        counts[num] = get(counts, num, 0) + 1
    end
    for num in sort(collect(keys(counts)); rev=true)
        if num <= counts[num]
            return num
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```

This function works by first counting the frequency of each number in the input list. Then it sorts the keys (the unique numbers) in descending order. It then iterates over the sorted keys, and if it finds a key that is less than or equal to its frequency, it returns that key. If no such key is found, it returns -1.
