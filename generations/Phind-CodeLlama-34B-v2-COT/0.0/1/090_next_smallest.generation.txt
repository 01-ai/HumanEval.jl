# Step-by-step outline:
# 1. Check if the length of the input vector is less than 2. If it is, return nothing because there is no 2nd smallest element.
# 2. If the length of the input vector is 2 or more, sort the vector in ascending order.
# 3. Return the 2nd element of the sorted vector.

# Julia code:
function next_smallest(xs::Vector{Int})::Union{Nothing,Int}
    # Check if the length of the input vector is less than 2
    if length(xs) < 2
        return nothing
    end

    # Sort the vector in ascending order
    sorted_xs = sort(xs)

    # Return the 2nd element of the sorted vector
    return sorted_xs[2]
end
