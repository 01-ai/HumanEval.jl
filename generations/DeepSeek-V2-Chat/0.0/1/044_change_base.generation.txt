Here's the implementation of the `change_base` function in Julia:

```julia
function change_base(x::Int, base::Int)::String
    if base < 2 || base > 9
        throw(ArgumentError("Base must be between 2 and 9"))
    end
    
    if x == 0
        return "0"
    end
    
    result = ""
    while x > 0
        remainder = x % base
        result = string(remainder, result)
        x = div(x, base)
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This function converts the integer `x` to the specified `base` and returns the result as a string. It handles the conversion by repeatedly dividing `x` by `base` and collecting the remainders, which represent the digits of the number in the new base. The remainders are concatenated in reverse order to form the final string representation.
