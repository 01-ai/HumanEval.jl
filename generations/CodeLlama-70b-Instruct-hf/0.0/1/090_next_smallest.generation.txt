function next_smallest(xs::Vector{Int})::Union{Nothing,Int}
    if length(xs) < 2
        return nothing
    end
    min_element = minimum(xs)
    next_smallest = nothing
    for element in xs
        if element != min_element && (next_smallest === nothing || element < next_smallest)
            next_smallest = element
        end
    end
    return next_smallest
end
```

This function first checks if the length of the input vector is less than 2. If it is, it returns `nothing` because there is no second smallest element. If the length is at least 2, it finds the minimum element in the vector and initializes the `next_smallest` variable to `nothing`. It then iterates through the vector and checks if the current element is not equal to the minimum element and is either less than the current `next_smallest` value or if `next_smallest` is still `nothing`. If either of these conditions is true, it updates the `next_smallest` value to the current element. After iterating through the entire vector, it returns the `next_smallest` value.
