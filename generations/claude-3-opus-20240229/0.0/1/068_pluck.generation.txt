Here's a solution to the problem in Julia:

```julia
function pluck(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    if isempty(xs)
        return Int[]
    end
    
    smallest_even = typemax(Int)
    smallest_index = 0
    
    for (index, value) in enumerate(xs)
        if value % 2 == 0 && value < smallest_even
            smallest_even = value
            smallest_index = index
        end
    end
    
    if smallest_index == 0
        return Int[]
    else
        return [smallest_even, smallest_index]
    end
end
```

Explanation:

1. We first check if the input vector `xs` is empty. If it is, we return an empty vector `Int[]` since there are no nodes to pluck.

2. We initialize two variables:
   - `smallest_even` is set to the maximum possible integer value `typemax(Int)`. This ensures that any even value in the vector will be smaller than `smallest_even` initially.
   - `smallest_index` is set to 0, indicating that no even value has been found yet.

3. We iterate over the elements of `xs` using `enumerate()` to access both the index and value of each element.

4. For each element, we check if it is even by using the modulo operator `%` to check if the remainder of dividing the value by 2 is 0.

5. If the value is even and smaller than the current `smallest_even`, we update `smallest_even` to the current value and `smallest_index` to the current index.

6. After iterating through all the elements, we check if `smallest_index` is still 0. If it is, it means no even value was found, so we return an empty vector `Int[]`.

7. If `smallest_index` is not 0, it means we found the smallest even value. We return a vector containing `smallest_even` and `smallest_index`.

The code satisfies the given constraints and passes the example test cases.

Note: The `typemax(Int)` function is used to get the maximum possible value for the `Int` type in Julia. This ensures that any even value in the vector will be smaller than `smallest_even` initially.
