 Here's the implementation of the `eat` function in Julia based on the provided doc string:

```julia
function eat(number::Int, need::Int, remaining::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Calculate the total number of carrots eaten after the meals
    total_eaten = number + min(need, remaining)
    
    # Calculate the number of carrots left after the meals
    carrots_left = max(remaining - need, 0)
    
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
end
```

This function first calculates the total number of carrots eaten by adding the initial number of eaten carrots to the minimum of the carrots needed and the remaining carrots. Then, it calculates the number of carrots left by subtracting the number of carrots needed from the remaining carrots, ensuring that the result is not negative.
