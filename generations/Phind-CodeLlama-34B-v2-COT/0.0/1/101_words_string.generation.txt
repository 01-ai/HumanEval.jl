# Outline

1. Use the built-in Julia function `split` to split the input string `s` into an array of words based on the delimiter which can be a comma or a space.
2. Use the `filter` function to remove any empty strings from the resulting array.
3. Return the filtered array of words.

# Code

```julia
function words_string(s::String)::Vector{String}
    # Split the string into words using comma or space as delimiter
    words = split(s, r"[ ,]")
    
    # Remove any empty strings from the array
    words = filter(word -> !isempty(word), words)
    
    # Return the array of words
    return words
end
```
