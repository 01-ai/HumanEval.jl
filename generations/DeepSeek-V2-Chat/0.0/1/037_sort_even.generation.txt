Here's the implementation of the `sort_even` function in Julia:

```julia
function sort_even(l::Vector)::Vector
    # Extract even-indexed elements and sort them
    even_elements = sort(l[2:2:end])
    
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the result
    result = similar(l)
    
    # Fill the result vector with odd-indexed elements from the original list
    result[1:2:end] = l[1:2:end]
    
    # Fill the result vector with sorted even-indexed elements
    result[2:2:end] = even_elements
    
    return result
end
```

This function works by first extracting and sorting the even-indexed elements of the input list. It then constructs the result list by placing the odd-indexed elements from the original list in their respective positions and inserting the sorted even-indexed elements into their respective positions.
