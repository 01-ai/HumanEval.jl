Here is the Julia function that implements the Fibonacci sequence:

```julia
function fib(n::Int)::Int
    if n <= 0
        return 0
    elseif n == 1
        return 1
    else
        a, b = 0, 1
        for i in 2:n
            a, b = b, a + b
        end
        return b
    end
end
```

This function uses a loop to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number. It starts with two variables `a` and `b` initialized to `0` and `1`, respectively. In each iteration of the loop, it updates `a` and `b` to the next two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The n-th Fibonacci number is stored in `b` after the loop finishes.
