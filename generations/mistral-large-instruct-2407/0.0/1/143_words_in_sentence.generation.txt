 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `words_in_sentence` function in Julia, which filters out words from a sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.

```julia
"""
    words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String

You are given a string representing a sentence, the sentence contains some words
separated by a space, and you have to return a string that contains the words
from the original sentence, whose lengths are prime numbers, the order of the
words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

Constraints:

    * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
    * sentence contains only letters

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> words_in_sentence("This is a test")
"is"

julia> words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming")
"go for"
```
"""
function words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String
    # Helper function to check if a number is prime
    function is_prime(n::Int)::Bool
        if n <= 1
            return false
        end
        for i in 2:isqrt(n)
            if n % i == 0
                return false
            end
        end
        return true
    end

    # Split the sentence into words
    words = split(sentence)

    # Filter words whose lengths are prime numbers
    prime_length_words = filter(word -> is_prime(length(word)), words)

    # Join the filtered words into a single string separated by spaces
    return join(prime_length_words, " ")
end

# Examples
println(words_in_sentence("This is a test"))  # Output: "is"
println(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming"))  # Output: "go for"
```

### Explanation:
1. **Prime Check Function**: The `is_prime` function checks if a given number `n` is a prime number. It returns `true` if `n` is prime and `false` otherwise.
2. **Splitting the Sentence**: The `split` function is used to split the input sentence into individual words.
3. **Filtering Words**: The `filter` function is used to keep only those words whose lengths are prime numbers.
4. **Joining Words**: The `join` function is used to concatenate the filtered words into a single string, separated by spaces.

This implementation ensures that the words in the resulting string maintain the same order as in the original sentence.
