Here is a step-by-step outline of how to solve this problem:

1. First, we need to sort the input list. We can use the `sort` function in Julia to do this.
2. Next, we need to remove duplicate elements from the sorted list. We can use the `unique` function in Julia to do this.
3. Finally, we return the sorted unique elements.

Here is the Julia code that implements this solution:

```julia
function unique_elements(l::Vector)
    return sort(unique(l))
end
```

This function works by first sorting the input list and then removing any duplicate elements. The `unique` function removes duplicate elements from an array, and the `sort` function sorts the array in ascending order. The sorted unique elements are then returned.
