```julia
function find_max(words::Vector{String})::String
    # Initialize variables to track the word with the maximum unique characters
    max_unique_count = 0
    result_word = ""
    
    for word in words
        # Calculate the number of unique characters in the current word
        unique_chars = length(Set(word))
        
        # Check if this word has more unique characters or if it's lexicographically smaller with the same count
        if unique_chars > max_unique_count || (unique_chars == max_unique_count && word < result_word)
            max_unique_count = unique_chars
            result_word = word
        end
    end
    
    return result_word
end
```

This function iterates through each word in the input vector, calculates the number of unique characters using a Set, and updates the result based on the conditions specified. It ensures that if multiple words have the same number of unique characters, the lexicographically first one is chosen.
