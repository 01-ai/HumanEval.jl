The provided content appears to be documentation for a Julia function called `strlen`. Let me break it down for you:

1. Function signature:
   ```julia
   strlen(x::String)::Int
   ```
   This indicates that `strlen` is a function that takes a single argument `x` of type `String` and returns an `Int`.

2. Description:
   "Return length of given string."

3. Examples section:
   ```julia
   julia> strlen(\)
   0

   julia> strlen(abc\)
   3
   ```

   These examples demonstrate the usage of the `strlen` function:
   - For an empty string `\`, it returns 0.
   - For the string `abc\`, it returns 3.

However, there are a few issues with the formatting:

1. The backslashes (`\`) are not properly escaped in the examples. In Julia, strings are typically enclosed in double quotes. The correct examples should be:

   ```julia
   julia> strlen("")
   0

   julia> strlen("abc")
   3
   ```

2. The documentation is wrapped in triple backslashes (`\\\`), which is not standard Julia documentation format. Julia typically uses triple backticks (```) for code blocks in documentation.

If you're writing documentation for a Julia function, you might want to use Julia's built-in documentation system with docstrings. Here's how it could look:

```julia
"""
    strlen(x::String)::Int

Return length of given string.

# Examples
```jldoctest
julia> strlen("")
0

julia> strlen("abc")
3
```
"""
function strlen(x::String)::Int
    # Function implementation here
end
```

This format would be more typical for Julia documentation and would work well with Julia's help system and documentation generation tools.
