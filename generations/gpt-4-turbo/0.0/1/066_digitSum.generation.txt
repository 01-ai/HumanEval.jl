```julia
function digitSum(s::String)::Int
    sum = 0
    for c in s
        if 'A' <= c <= 'Z'
            sum += Int(c)
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z'), it adds the ASCII value of the character to the `sum`. The ASCII value is obtained by converting the character `c` to an integer using `Int(c)`. The function finally returns the accumulated sum.
