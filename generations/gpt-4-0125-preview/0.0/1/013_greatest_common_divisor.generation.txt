Certainly! Below is the Julia function `greatest_common_divisor` that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.

```julia
function greatest_common_divisor(a::Int, b::Int)::Int
    while b != 0
        a, b = b, a % b
    end
    return abs(a)
end
```

This function works by repeatedly replacing the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The last non-zero value is the greatest common divisor. The `abs` function ensures the result is always positive, which is a common convention for GCD.
