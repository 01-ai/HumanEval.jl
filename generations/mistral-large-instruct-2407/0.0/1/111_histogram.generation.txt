 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `histogram` function in Julia based on the provided docstring:

```julia
"""
    histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}

Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a
dictionary of the letter with the most repetition and containing the
corresponding count. If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of
them.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> histogram("a b c")
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 1
  "b" => 1
  "a" => 1

julia> histogram("a b b a")
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 2

julia> histogram("a b c a b")
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 2

julia> histogram("b b b b a")
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "b" => 4

julia> histogram("")
Dict{String, Int64}()
```
"""
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    # Split the string into an array of words
    words = split(s)

    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each word
    counts = Dict{String, Int}()

    for word in words
        if haskey(counts, word)
            counts[word] += 1
        else
            counts[word] = 1
        end
    end

    # Find the maximum count
    max_count = isempty(counts) ? 0 : maximum(values(counts))

    # Filter the dictionary to include only the words with the maximum count
    result = Dict{String, Int}()
    for (word, count) in counts
        if count == max_count
            result[word] = count
        end
    end

    return result
end
```

This function first splits the input string into an array of words. It then counts the occurrences of each word using a dictionary. After determining the maximum count, it filters the dictionary to include only the words with the maximum count and returns the resulting dictionary.
