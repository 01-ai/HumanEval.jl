Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    return xs .+ 1
end
```

This function uses broadcasting to add 1 to each element in the input vector. The `.+` operator is a broadcasted operation that applies the `+` function element-wise across the input vectors.
