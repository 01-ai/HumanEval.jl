    odd_count(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}

Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a
list. Each element `i` of the output should be "the number of odd elements in
the string i of the input." where all the i"s should be replaced by the number
of odd digits in the i"th string of the input.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> odd_count(["1234567"])
1-element Vector{String}:
 "the number of odd elements 4n the str4ng 4 of the 4nput."

julia> odd_count(["3", "11111111"])
2-element Vector{String}:
 "the number of odd elements 1n the str1ng 1 of the 1nput."
 "the number of odd elements 8n the str8ng 8 of the 8nput."
```

To implement the `odd_count` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `odd_count` that takes a vector of strings `xs` as input.
2. Initialize an empty vector of strings `result` to store the output.
3. Loop through each string in the input vector `xs`.
4. For each string, count the number of odd digits.
5. Create the output string by replacing the letter 'i' with the number of odd digits found in step 4.
6. Append the output string to the `result` vector.
7. Return the `result` vector after the loop ends.

Now, let's write the code for the `odd_count` function.
