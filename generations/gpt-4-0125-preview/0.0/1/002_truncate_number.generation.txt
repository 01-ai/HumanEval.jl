To implement the `truncate_number` function as described, you can subtract the integer part of the number from the original number to get the decimal part. Here's how you can do it in Julia:

```julia
function truncate_number(number::Float64)::Float64
    # Extract the integer part of the number
    integer_part = floor(number)
    
    # Subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    
    return decimal_part
end
```

This function first uses the `floor` function to get the integer part of the number, which is the largest integer smaller than the given number. Then, it subtracts this integer part from the original number to isolate the decimal part, which is then returned.
