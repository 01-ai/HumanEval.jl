To solve this problem, we need to check if the parentheses in the concatenated strings can be balanced. Here's a solution in Julia:

```julia
function match_parens(lst::Vector{String})::String
    left = 0
    right = 0
    
    for str in lst
        for c in str
            if c == '('
                left += 1
            elseif c == ')'
                if left > 0
                    left -= 1
                else
                    right += 1
                end
            end
        end
    end
    
    if left == right
        return "Yes"
    else
        return "No"
    end
end
```

Explanation:
1. We initialize two variables, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the count of open and close parentheses respectively.

2. We iterate over each string in the input list `lst`.

3. For each string, we iterate over each character:
   - If the character is an open parenthesis `(`, we increment the `left` count.
   - If the character is a close parenthesis `)`, we check if there is a matching open parenthesis:
     - If `left` is greater than 0, it means there is an open parenthesis available, so we decrement `left`.
     - If `left` is 0, it means there is no matching open parenthesis, so we increment `right`.

4. After processing all the strings, we check if the count of open parentheses `left` is equal to the count of close parentheses `right`:
   - If they are equal, it means the parentheses can be balanced, so we return "Yes".
   - If they are not equal, it means the parentheses cannot be balanced, so we return "No".

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the total length of all the strings in the input list. We iterate over each character in each string once.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

```jldoctest
julia> match_parens(["()(", ")"])
"Yes"

julia> match_parens([")", ")"])
"No"

julia> match_parens(["(", "())"])
"Yes"

julia> match_parens(["(", ")))"])
"No"
```
