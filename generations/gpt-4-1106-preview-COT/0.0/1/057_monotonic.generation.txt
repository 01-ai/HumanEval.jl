To implement the `monotonic` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Check if the input vector `l` is empty or has only one element. If so, return `true` because a single element or no elements can be considered trivially monotonic.

2. Determine the direction of monotonicity by comparing the first two different elements in the list. If the second element is greater than the first, we will assume the list should be monotonically increasing; otherwise, it should be monotonically decreasing.

3. Iterate through the list starting from the second element and compare each element with the previous one to ensure that the sequence is either non-decreasing or non-increasing, depending on the direction determined in step 2.

4. If at any point we find a pair of elements that violate the monotonicity direction, return `false`.

5. If we reach the end of the list without finding any violations, return `true`.

Now, let's implement the code for the `monotonic` function:

```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    # Step 1: Check for trivial cases
    length_l = length(l)
    if length_l <= 1
        return true
    end
    
    # Step 2: Determine the direction of monotonicity
    increasing = nothing
    for i in 2:length_l
        if l[i] != l[i-1]
            increasing = l[i] > l[i-1]
            break
        end
    end
    
    # If all elements are equal, the list is monotonic
    if increasing === nothing
        return true
    end
    
    # Step 3: Check for monotonicity
    for i in 2:length_l
        if increasing && l[i] < l[i-1]
            return false
        elseif !increasing && l[i] > l[i-1]
            return false
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: If no violations found, the list is monotonic
    return true
end
```

This function should now work as expected for the given examples.
