Here is a step-by-step outline of how to implement the `sum_to_n` function:

1. Define a function `sum_to_n` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Inside the function, use the formula `n*(n+1)/2` to calculate the sum of numbers from `1` to `n`.
3. Return the calculated sum.

Here is the Julia code that implements the `sum_to_n` function:

```julia
function sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int
    return n * (n + 1) � 2
end
```

This function uses the formula `n*(n+1)/2` to calculate the sum of numbers from `1` to `n`. The `�` operator is used for integer division, which discards the fractional part and returns an integer.
