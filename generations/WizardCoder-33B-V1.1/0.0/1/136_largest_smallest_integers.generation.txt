Here is the Julia function that implements the above doc string:

```julia
function largest_smallest_integers(xs::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Union{Nothing, Int}, Union{Nothing,Int}}
    negatives = filter(x -> x < 0, xs)
    positives = filter(x -> x > 0, xs)
    if isempty(negatives)
        a = nothing
    else
        a = maximum(negatives)
    end
    if isempty(positives)
        b = nothing
    else
        b = minimum(positives)
    end
    return a, b
end
```

This function first filters the input list into two lists: one for negative numbers and one for positive numbers. It then checks if these lists are empty and assigns `nothing` if they are, otherwise it finds the maximum of the negative numbers and the minimum of the positive numbers.
