Here is a Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function move_one_ball(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool
    n = length(xs)
    if n <= 1
        return true
    end
    count = 0
    for i in 1:n
        if xs[i] > xs[mod1(i+1, n)]
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count <= 1
end
```

This function works by iterating over the array and checking if the current element is greater than the next element. If it is, it increments a counter. If the counter is greater than 1, it returns false because it is not possible to sort the array by performing a right shift operation. If the counter is 0 or 1, it returns true because it is possible to sort the array by performing a right shift operation.

The mod1 function is used to handle the case where the next element is the first element of the array. If the current element is the last element of the array, the next element is the first element of the array.

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1), because the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the counter.
