Here's a solution to the `strange_sort_list` problem in Julia:

```julia
function strange_sort_list(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    result = Int[]
    sorted_xs = sort(xs)
    
    left = 1
    right = length(sorted_xs)
    
    while left <= right
        push!(result, sorted_xs[left])
        left += 1
        
        if left <= right
            push!(result, sorted_xs[right])
            right -= 1
        end
    end
    
    return result
end
```

Explanation:

1. We start by creating an empty vector `result` to store the strangely sorted integers.

2. We sort the input vector `xs` in ascending order and store it in `sorted_xs`. This helps us easily access the minimum and maximum values.

3. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to the leftmost and rightmost elements of `sorted_xs`, respectively.

4. We enter a loop that continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

5. Inside the loop, we append the minimum value (`sorted_xs[left]`) to `result` and increment `left` by 1.

6. We then check if `left` is still less than or equal to `right`. If true, we append the maximum value (`sorted_xs[right]`) to `result` and decrement `right` by 1.

7. We repeat steps 5 and 6 until `left` becomes greater than `right`. This ensures that we alternate between appending the minimum and maximum values to `result`.

8. Finally, we return the `result` vector containing the strangely sorted integers.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input vector `xs`. The space complexity is O(n) as we create a new vector `result` to store the strangely sorted integers.

The solution handles the given examples correctly:

```jldoctest
julia> strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 2
 3

julia> strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5])
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 5
 5
 5

julia> strange_sort_list(Int[])
Int64[]
```
