Here's a solution to the problem using Julia:

```julia
function move_one_ball(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool
    n = length(xs)
    if n <= 1
        return true
    end
    
    min_val = minimum(xs)
    min_index = findfirst(x -> x == min_val, xs)
    
    sorted_xs = sort(xs)
    
    for i in 1:n
        if xs != sorted_xs
            xs = circshift(xs, 1)
        else
            return true
        end
    end
    
    return false
end
```

Explanation:
1. We first check if the length of the array `xs` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, we return `true` since an empty array or an array with a single element is already considered sorted.

2. We find the minimum value `min_val` in the array `xs` using the `minimum` function.

3. We find the index `min_index` of the first occurrence of `min_val` in `xs` using the `findfirst` function.

4. We create a new array `sorted_xs` by sorting the elements of `xs` in non-decreasing order using the `sort` function.

5. We start a loop that iterates `n` times (where `n` is the length of `xs`). In each iteration:
   - We check if `xs` is equal to `sorted_xs`. If they are equal, it means we have obtained the sorted array, so we return `true`.
   - If `xs` is not equal to `sorted_xs`, we perform a right shift operation on `xs` using the `circshift` function with a shift of 1 position.

6. If we complete the loop without returning `true`, it means it is not possible to obtain the sorted array by performing any number of right shift operations. In this case, we return `false`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the array. This is because we perform a maximum of n right shift operations, and each shift operation takes O(n) time. The space complexity is O(n) to store the sorted array.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
