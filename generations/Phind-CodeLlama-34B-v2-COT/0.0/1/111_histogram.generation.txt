To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each letter.
2. Split the input string into individual letters.
3. Iterate over the letters and increment their count in the dictionary.
4. Find the maximum count in the dictionary.
5. Iterate over the dictionary and add all the letters with the maximum count to the output dictionary.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above steps:

```julia
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each letter.
    freq = Dict{String, Int}()

    # Step 2: Split the input string into individual letters.
    letters = split(s)

    # Step 3: Iterate over the letters and increment their count in the dictionary.
    for letter in letters
        if haskey(freq, letter)
            freq[letter] += 1
        else
            freq[letter] = 1
        end
    end

    # Step 4: Find the maximum count in the dictionary.
    max_count = maximum(values(freq), init=0)

    # Step 5: Iterate over the dictionary and add all the letters with the maximum count to the output dictionary.
    output = Dict{String, Int}()
    for (letter, count) in freq
        if count == max_count
            output[letter] = count
        end
    end

    return output
end
```

This function works by first creating a frequency dictionary of all the letters in the input string. It then finds the maximum count and creates an output dictionary containing all the letters with that count.
