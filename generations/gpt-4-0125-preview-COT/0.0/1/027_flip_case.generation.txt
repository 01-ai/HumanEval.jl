### Outline for Implementing `flip_case` Function

1. **Initialize an empty string**: This will be used to accumulate the characters with their cases flipped.

2. **Iterate through each character in the input string**: We will go through each character to check its case and flip it accordingly.

3. **Check the case of each character**:
    - If the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase.
    - If the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase.
    - If the character is neither (e.g., a digit or punctuation), leave it as is.

4. **Append the flipped character to the accumulator string**: After flipping the case of the character, add it to the accumulator string.

5. **Return the accumulator string**: Once all characters have been processed, return the accumulator string as the result.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function flip_case(s::String)::String
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty string to accumulate results
    flipped_string = ""
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in s
        # Step 3: Check the case of each character and flip it
        if islower(char)
            flipped_string *= uppercase(char)  # Convert to uppercase and append
        elseif isupper(char)
            flipped_string *= lowercase(char)  # Convert to lowercase and append
        else
            flipped_string *= char  # Append the character as is
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return the accumulator string
    return flipped_string
end
```

This function works by iterating through each character of the input string, checking its case, flipping it if it's an alphabetic character, and accumulating the result in a new string that is returned at the end.
