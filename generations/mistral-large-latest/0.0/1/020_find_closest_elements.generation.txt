Sure, here's a Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:

```julia
function find_closest_elements(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Tuple{Float64, Float64}
    if length(numbers) < 2
        error("The vector must contain at least two elements.")
    end

    sort!(numbers)
    min_diff = Inf
    closest_pair = (numbers[1], numbers[2])

    for i in 1:(length(numbers) - 1)
        diff = numbers[i+1] - numbers[i]
        if diff < min_diff
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i+1])
        end
    end

    return closest_pair
end
```

This function first sorts the input vector in ascending order. Then it iterates over the vector, calculating the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers. If the difference is less than the current minimum difference, it updates the minimum difference and the closest pair of numbers. Finally, it returns the closest pair of numbers.
