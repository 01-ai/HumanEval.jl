Sure, here is the Julia function based on the given docstring:

```julia
function get_max_triples(n::Int)::Int
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in 1:n]
    count = 0
    for i in 1:n-2
        for j in i+1:n-1
            for k in j+1:n
                if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k]) % 3 == 0
                    count += 1
                end
            end
        end
    end
    return count
end
```
This function first creates an array `a` where each element is calculated as `i * i - i + 1`. Then it iterates over all possible triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` where `i < j < k` and checks if their sum is a multiple of 3. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.
