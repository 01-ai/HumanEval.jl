Here is the implementation of the `find_closest_elements` function in Julia:

```julia
function find_closest_elements(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Tuple{Float64, Float64}
    min_diff = Inf
    closest_pair = (0.0, 0.0)
    
    for i in 1:length(numbers)-1
        for j in i+1:length(numbers)
            diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            if diff < min_diff
                min_diff = diff
                closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[j])
            end
        end
    end
    
    return closest_pair
end
```

This function iterates over all pairs of numbers in the input list and keeps track of the pair with the smallest difference. It returns this pair as a tuple.
