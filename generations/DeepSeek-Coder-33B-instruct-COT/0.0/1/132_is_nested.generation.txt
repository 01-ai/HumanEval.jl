Here is a step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over the string.
3. If the current character is an opening bracket '[', push it into the stack.
4. If the current character is a closing bracket ']', pop the top element from the stack.
5. If the stack is empty after popping, return `true`.
6. If the stack is not empty after iterating over the string, return `false`.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function is_nested(s::String)::Bool
    stack = []
    for bracket in s
        if bracket == '['
            pushfirst(stack, bracket)
        elseif bracket == ']'
            isempty(stack) && return true
            popfirst(stack)
        end
    end
    return isempty(stack)
end
```

This function works by using a stack to keep track of the brackets. When it encounters an opening bracket, it pushes it onto the stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it pops the top element from the stack. If the stack is empty after popping, it means that there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested, so it returns `true`. If the stack is not empty after iterating over the string, it means that there are unmatched brackets, so it returns `false`.
