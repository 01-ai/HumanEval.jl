Here is the Julia implementation of the `monotonic` function based on the provided docstring:

```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    if length(l) < 2
        return true
    end

    dir = l[2] - l[1]
    for i in 3:length(l)
        if (l[i] - l[i-1]) * dir < 0
            return false
        end
        dir = l[i] - l[i-1]
    end

    return true
end
```

This function works by initializing a direction variable `dir` to the difference between the second and first elements of the list. Then, it iterates over the rest of the list, checking if the difference between consecutive elements is of the same sign as `dir`. If it encounters an element with a different sign, it returns `false`. If it finishes iterating without encountering any such elements, it returns `true`.
