Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Check if the input array is empty or contains only one element. If so, return the input array as it is already sorted.
2. Calculate the sum of the first and last elements of the input array.
3. If the sum is odd, sort the array in ascending order.
4. If the sum is even, sort the array in descending order.
5. Return the sorted array.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function sort_array_based_on_head_tail(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Check if the array is empty or contains only one element
    if isempty(xs) || length(xs) == 1
        return xs
    end

    # Calculate the sum of the first and last elements
    sum_first_last = xs[1] + xs[end]

    # Sort the array based on the parity of the sum
    if sum_first_last % 2 == 0
        return sort(xs, rev=true)
    else
        return sort(xs)
    end
end
```

This function first checks if the input array is empty or contains only one element. If so, it returns the input array as it is already sorted. Then, it calculates the sum of the first and last elements of the input array. If the sum is even, the function sorts the array in descending order. If the sum is odd, the function sorts the array in ascending order. Finally, the sorted array is returned.
