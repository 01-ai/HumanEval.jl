You can implement the `concatenate` function in Julia as follows:

```julia
function concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String
    return join(xs)
end
```

This function uses the `join` function from Julia's base library to concatenate the strings in the input vector. The `join` function takes a vector of strings and concatenates them into a single string, with no separator. If the input vector is empty, `join` returns an empty string.
