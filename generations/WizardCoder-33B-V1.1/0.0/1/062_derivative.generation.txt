Here is the Julia function that implements the doc string:

```julia
function derivative(xs::Vector)::Vector
    n = length(xs)
    return [i * xs[i+1] for i in 1:n-1]
end
```

This function works by iterating over the indices of the input vector (excluding the last one), and for each index `i`, it multiplies the coefficient `xs[i+1]` by the index `i` to get the coefficient of the derivative term. The result is a vector of these derivative coefficients.
