Here's the implementation of the `search` function in Julia:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each number
    frequency = Dict{Int, Int}()
    
    # Count the frequency of each number in the list
    for num in numbers
        if haskey(frequency, num)
            frequency[num] += 1
        else
            frequency[num] = 1
        end
    end
    
    # Find the greatest integer that meets the criteria
    result = -1
    for (num, freq) in frequency
        if freq >= num && num > result
            result = num
        end
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This function first counts the frequency of each number in the list using a dictionary. Then, it iterates through the dictionary to find the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. If no such integer is found, it returns `-1`.
