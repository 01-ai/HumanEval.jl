Here is a Julia function that implements the `specialFilter` function as described in the problem:

```julia
function specialFilter(nums::Vector{Int})::Int
    count = 0
    for num in nums
        if num > 10 && (num % 10 in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) && (abs(num) � 10 � 10 % 10 in [1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates over each number in the input array. For each number, it checks if the number is greater than 10 and if the last and first digits of the absolute value of the number are odd. If both conditions are met, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.
