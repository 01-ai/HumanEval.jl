To solve this problem, we will first check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, we return `false`. Then, we will check the case of the first key in the dictionary. If all keys have the same case as the first key, we return `true`. If not, we return `false`.

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, return `false`.
2. Get the first key from the dictionary.
3. Check the case of the first key. If it's lower case, iterate through the rest of the keys and check if they are also lower case. If they are not, return `false`.
4. If the first key is upper case, iterate through the rest of the keys and check if they are also upper case. If they are not, return `false`.
5. If all keys have the same case as the first key, return `true`.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function check_dict_case(d::Dict{String, String})::Bool
    # Check if the dictionary is empty
    if isempty(d)
        return false
    end

    # Get the first key from the dictionary
    first_key = first(keys(d))

    # Check the case of the first key
    if islowercase(first_key)
        # Iterate through the rest of the keys and check if they are also lower case
        for key in keys(d)
            if !islowercase(key)
                return false
            end
        end
    elseif isuppercase(first_key)
        # Iterate through the rest of the keys and check if they are also upper case
        for key in keys(d)
            if !isuppercase(key)
                return false
            end
        end
    end

    # If all keys have the same case as the first key, return true
    return true
end
```

This function works by first checking if the dictionary is empty. If it is, it returns `false`. Then, it gets the first key from the dictionary and checks its case. If all keys in the dictionary have the same case as the first key, it returns `true`. If not, it returns `false`.
