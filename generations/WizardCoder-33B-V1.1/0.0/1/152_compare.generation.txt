Here is the Julia function that implements the logic described in the problem:

```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    return abs.(game .- guess)
end
```

This function uses the `abs` function to calculate the absolute difference between each pair of corresponding elements in the `game` and `guess` vectors. The `.` operator is used to apply the `abs` function element-wise to the result of subtracting the corresponding elements.

Here is how you can test the function:

```julia
println(compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]))
println(compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]))
```

This will output:

```julia
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 0
 0
 0
 3
 3

6-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 4
 1
 0
 0
 6
```
