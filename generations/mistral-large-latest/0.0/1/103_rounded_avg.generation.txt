Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function rounded_avg(n::Int, m::Int)::Union{Int, String}
    if n > m
        return -1
    else
        avg = round(Int, (n + m) * 0.5 + sum(n+1:m-1))
        return bin(avg)[3:end]
    end
end
```
This function first checks if `n` is greater than `m`. If it is, it returns `-1`. If not, it calculates the average of all integers from `n` to `m`, rounds it to the nearest integer, converts it to binary, and returns the binary string. The `[3:end]` is used to remove the leading `0b` from the binary representation.
