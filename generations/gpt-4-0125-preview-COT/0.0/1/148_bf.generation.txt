### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Define the Order of Planets**: Create a list (or array) that represents the planets in the order of their distance from the Sun. This will serve as a reference for determining the positions of the planets.

2. **Validate Input**: Check if both `planet1` and `planet2` are in the list of planets. If either is not, return an empty tuple as per the function's specification.

3. **Find Positions**: Determine the positions (indexes) of `planet1` and `planet2` within the list of planets.

4. **Determine Range**: Based on the positions of `planet1` and `planet2`, determine the range of planets that lie between them. This involves finding the correct slice of the list, taking into account the order of the input planets (i.e., if `planet1` is farther from the Sun than `planet2`, we need to reverse the order).

5. **Return Result**: Return the determined range of planets as a tuple.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function bf(planet1::String, planet2::String)::NTuple
    # Step 1: Define the order of planets
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    
    # Step 2: Validate Input
    if !(planet1 in planets) || !(planet2 in planets)
        return ()
    end
    
    # Step 3: Find Positions
    pos1 = findfirst(==(planet1), planets)
    pos2 = findfirst(==(planet2), planets)
    
    # Step 4: Determine Range
    if pos1 < pos2
        result = planets[pos1+1:pos2-1]
    else
        result = planets[pos2+1:pos1-1]
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return Result
    return tuple(result...)
end
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps to ensure that the function behaves as specified, including handling invalid inputs and correctly identifying the range of planets between the two given planets.
