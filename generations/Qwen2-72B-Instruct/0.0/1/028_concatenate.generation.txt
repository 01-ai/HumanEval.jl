Here is the Julia function that meets the given specifications:

```julia
function concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String
    return join(xs)
end
```

This function uses the `join` function provided by Julia, which concatenates the elements of an array into a single string, using a specified separator (which is an empty string in this case). This is a simple and efficient way to concatenate a list of strings in Julia.
