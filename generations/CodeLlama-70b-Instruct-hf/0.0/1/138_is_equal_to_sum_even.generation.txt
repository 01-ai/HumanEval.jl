```julia
function is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int)::Bool
    if n < 8
        return false
    end
    if n % 4 != 0
        return false
    end
    return true
end
```

This function first checks if the input number is less than 8. If it is, it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. Then, it checks if the input number is divisible by 4. If it is not, it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers. If both checks pass, it returns true, indicating that the input number can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
