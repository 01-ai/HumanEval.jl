```julia
function string_xor(a::String, b::String)::String
    # Ensure both strings are of the same length
    if length(a) != length(b)
        throw(ArgumentError("Both strings must be of the same length"))
    end
    
    # Perform XOR operation character by character
    result = [xor(parse(Int, a[i]), parse(Int, b[i])) for i in 1:length(a)]
    
    # Convert the result array back to a string
    return join(string.(result))
end
```

This function `string_xor` takes two binary strings `a` and `b`, checks if they are of the same length, and then performs a bitwise XOR operation on each corresponding pair of characters. The result is collected in an array and then converted back to a string which is returned.
