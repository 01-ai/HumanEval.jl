Here is a possible implementation of the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function in Julia:

```julia
function pairs_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    seen = Set{Int}()
    for num in l
        if num in seen
            return true
        end
        push!(seen, -num)
    end
    return false
end
```

This function works by maintaining a set of the numbers seen so far. For each number in the input list, it checks if the number is already in the set. If it is, then there are two numbers in the list that sum to zero (the current number and the number in the set). If the number is not in the set, it adds the negation of the number to the set. After checking all the numbers in the list, if no pair sums to zero, the function returns false.
