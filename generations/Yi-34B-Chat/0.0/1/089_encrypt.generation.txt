```julia

    # Initialize an empty string to store the encrypted text
    encrypted_text = ""

    # Loop over each character in the input string
    for c in s
        # Get the ASCII value of the current character
        char_code = Int(c)

        # If the character is a letter (a-z or A-Z), rotate it by 2*2 positions
        if (char_code >= 97) && (char_code <= 122) # Lowercase letters
            # Rotate the character by 2*2 positions
            new_char_code = mod(char_code - 2*2, 26) + 97
            # Append the rotated character to the encrypted text
            encrypted_text *= String(new_char_code)
        elseif (char_code >= 65) && (char_code <= 90) # Uppercase letters
            # Rotate the character by 2*2 positions
            new_char_code = mod(char_code - 2*2, 26) + 65
            # Append the rotated character to the encrypted text
            encrypted_text *= String(new_char_code)
        else
            # If the character is not a letter, just append it as is
            encrypted_text *= c

end
```

This function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as an argument and returns an encrypted version of the string where each letter is rotated by two positions (twice). Non-letter characters are left unchanged.
