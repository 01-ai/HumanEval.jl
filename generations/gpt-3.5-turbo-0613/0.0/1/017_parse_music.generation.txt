Here is the implementation for the `parse_music` function:

```julia
function parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}
    notes = split(music_string)
    durations = []
    for note in notes
        if note == "o"
            push!(durations, 4)
        elseif note == "o|"
            push!(durations, 2)
        elseif note == ".|"
            push!(durations, 1)
        end
    end
    return durations
end
```

This function splits the input string into individual notes and then checks each note to determine its duration. The corresponding duration is then added to the `durations` array. Finally, the `durations` array is returned as the result.
