Here is the Julia function based on the given docstring:

```julia
function modp(n::Int, p::Int)::Int
    return mod(2^n, p)
end
```

This function takes two integer arguments, `n` and `p`, and returns `2^n modulo p`. The `mod` function in Julia is used to compute the remainder of the division of `2^n` by `p`.
