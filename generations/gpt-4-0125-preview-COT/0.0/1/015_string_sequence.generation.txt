### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize an empty string**: This will be used to accumulate the numbers from 0 to `n`.

2. **Loop through numbers from 0 to `n`**:
   - For each number, convert it to a string.
   - Append this string to the accumulator string from step 1.
   - Add a space after each number except for the last one.

3. **Return the final string**: After the loop, the accumulator string will contain all numbers from 0 to `n` as required. Return this string.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function string_sequence(n::Int)::String
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty string
    result = ""
    
    # Step 2: Loop through numbers from 0 to `n`
    for i in 0:n
        # Convert number to string and append to the result
        # Add a space after each number except for the last one
        result *= "$i"
        if i < n
            result *= " "
        end
    end
    
    # Step 3: Return the final string
    return result
end
```

This function should work as expected based on the provided examples.
