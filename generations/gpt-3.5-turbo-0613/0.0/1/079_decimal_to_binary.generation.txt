Here is the implementation of the `decimal_to_binary` function in Julia:

```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    binary = ""
    while decimal > 0
        remainder = decimal % 2
        binary = string(remainder) * binary
        decimal = decimal รท 2
    end
    return "db" * binary * "db"
end
```

This function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and store the remainder as a binary digit. The binary digits are then concatenated to form the binary representation of the decimal number. Finally, the function returns the binary representation with the extra characters 'db' at the beginning and end.
