Here's the implementation of the `compare` function in Julia:

```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    return [g == s ? 0 : abs(g - s) for (s, g) in zip(game, guess)]
end
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over pairs of scores and guesses, calculating the absolute difference if the guess is not correct, or 0 if it is. The `zip` function is used to pair up corresponding elements from the `game` and `guess` arrays.
