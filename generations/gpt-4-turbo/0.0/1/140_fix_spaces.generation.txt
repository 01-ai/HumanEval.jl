```julia
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # Replace multiple spaces with a single dash
    s = replace(s, r"\s{2,}" => "-")
    # Replace remaining single spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")
    return s
end
```

This function uses regular expressions to handle the replacement of spaces. The `replace` function is used twice:
1. First, it targets sequences of two or more spaces (`\s{2,}`) and replaces them with a single dash (`-`).
2. Then, it replaces any remaining single spaces with underscores (`_`). 

This approach ensures that all consecutive spaces are replaced with a dash first, before handling individual spaces, which matches the requirements specified in the docstring examples.
