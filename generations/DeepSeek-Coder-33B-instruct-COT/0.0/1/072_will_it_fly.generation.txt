Here is a step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Check if the list `q` is a palindrome.
2. Calculate the sum of the elements in `q`.
3. Check if the sum is less than or equal to `w`.
4. If both conditions are met, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the list is a palindrome
    if q != reverse(q)
        return false
    end

    # Calculate the sum of the elements
    sum_q = sum(q)

    # Check if the sum is less than or equal to w
    if sum_q > w
        return false
    end

    # If both conditions are met, return true
    return true
end
```

This function works by first checking if the list `q` is a palindrome. If it is not, the function immediately returns `false`. If `q` is a palindrome, the function then calculates the sum of its elements and checks if this sum is less than or equal to `w`. If the sum is greater than `w`, the function returns `false`. If the sum is less than or equal to `w`, the function returns `true`.
