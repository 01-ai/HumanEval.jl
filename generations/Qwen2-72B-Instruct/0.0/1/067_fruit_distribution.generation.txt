```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Extract the number of apples and oranges from the string
    numbers = map(int, matchall(r"(\d+)", s))
    apples, oranges = numbers[1], numbers[2]
    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges
    return mangoes
end
```
This function uses regular expressions to extract the number of apples and oranges from the input string, converts them to integers, and then calculates the number of mangoes by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.
