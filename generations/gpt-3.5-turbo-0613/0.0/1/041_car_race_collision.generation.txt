Here is the implementation of the `car_race_collision` function:

```julia
function car_race_collision(n::Int)::Int
    return n * (n - 1) รท 2
end
```

The function calculates the number of collisions by using the formula `n * (n - 1) รท 2`, where `n` is the number of cars. This formula calculates the number of combinations of 2 cars out of `n` cars.
