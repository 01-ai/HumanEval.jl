### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Define the function `strongest_extension` with the parameters `class_name` as a `String` and `extensions` as a `Vector{String}`.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the strongest extension found so far and its strength.
3. Iterate over each extension in the `extensions` vector.
4. For each extension, calculate the strength by counting the uppercase letters (CAP) and subtracting the number of lowercase letters (SM).
5. Compare the calculated strength with the current strongest strength.
6. If the calculated strength is greater, update the strongest extension and its strength.
7. If the calculated strength is equal to the current strongest strength, keep the first one encountered (as per the instructions).
8. After iterating through all extensions, return the string in the format `ClassName.StrongestExtensionName`.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function strongest_extension(class_name::String, extensions::Vector{String})::String
    # Initialize the strongest extension and its strength
    strongest_ext = ""
    strongest_strength = -Inf  # Start with negative infinity to ensure any strength will be greater

    # Iterate over each extension
    for ext in extensions
        # Calculate the strength of the extension
        CAP = count(isuppercase, ext)
        SM = count(islowercase, ext)
        strength = CAP - SM

        # Update the strongest extension if necessary
        if strength > strongest_strength
            strongest_ext = ext
            strongest_strength = strength
        end
    end

    # Return the result in the required format
    return class_name * "." * strongest_ext
end
```

Now, let's implement the function in Julia.
