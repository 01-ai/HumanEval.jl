 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `file_name_check` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
file_name_check(file_name::String)::String

Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise. A file's name
is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions are met:

  - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
  - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
  - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a
    letter from the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
  - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ["txt", "exe", "dll"]

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> file_name_check("example.txt")
"Yes"

julia> file_name_check("1example.dll")  #  (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)
"No"
```
"""
function file_name_check(file_name::String)::String
    # Check if there are more than three digits
    if count(c -> isdigit(c), file_name) > 3
        return "No"
    end

    # Check if there is exactly one dot
    if count(c -> c == '.', file_name) != 1
        return "No"
    end

    # Split the file name into the name and extension
    parts = split(file_name, '.')
    name = parts[1]
    extension = parts[2]

    # Check if the name is not empty and starts with a letter
    if isempty(name) || !isletter(name[1])
        return "No"
    end

    # Check if the extension is one of the allowed ones
    if extension âˆ‰ ["txt", "exe", "dll"]
        return "No"
    end

    return "Yes"
end

# Examples
println(file_name_check("example.txt"))  # "Yes"
println(file_name_check("1example.dll")) # "No"
```

This function checks each condition specified in the docstring and returns "Yes" if all conditions are met, otherwise it returns "No".
