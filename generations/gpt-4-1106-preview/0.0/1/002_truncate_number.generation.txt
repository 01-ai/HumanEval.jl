Certainly! Below is the Julia function `truncate_number` that implements the functionality described in the docstring:

```julia
function truncate_number(number::Float64)::Float64
    # Extract the integer part of the number
    integer_part = floor(number)
    
    # Subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    
    return decimal_part
end

# Example usage
println(truncate_number(3.5))  # Output should be 0.5
```

This function uses the `floor` function to obtain the integer part of the number, and then subtracts it from the original number to get the decimal part. The result is returned as the output of the function.
