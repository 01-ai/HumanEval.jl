```julia
function filter_by_substring(strings::Vector{String}, substring::AbstractString)::Vector{String}
    return filter(s -> occursin(substring, s), strings)
end
```

This function takes a vector of strings and a substring as input and returns a vector of strings that contain the given substring. It uses the `filter` function to filter the input vector based on the condition that the substring occurs in each string.
