To implement the `longest` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Check if the input vector `xs` is empty. If it is, return `nothing`.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the longest string found so far. We can start with the first string in the vector.
3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum length found so far. We can start with the length of the first string in the vector.
4. Iterate over the strings in the vector starting from the second string.
5. For each string, check if its length is greater than the maximum length found so far.
6. If it is, update the longest string and the maximum length with the current string and its length.
7. After the iteration, return the longest string found.

Now, let's write the code for the `longest` function:

```julia
function longest(xs::Vector{String})::Union{Nothing, String}
    # Step 1: Check if the input vector is empty
    if isempty(xs)
        return nothing
    end

    # Step 2 and 3: Initialize variables for the longest string and its length
    longest_str = xs[1]
    max_length = length(longest_str)

    # Step 4: Iterate over the strings in the vector
    for str in xs[2:end]
        # Step 5: Check if the current string is longer than the longest found so far
        if length(str) > max_length
            # Step 6: Update the longest string and its length
            longest_str = str
            max_length = length(str)
        end
    end

    # Step 7: Return the longest string
    return longest_str
end
```

This function should work as expected based on the provided doc string and examples.
