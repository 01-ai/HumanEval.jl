```julia
function n_digits_in_binary(N::Int)::String
    # Initialize an empty string to store the binary representation of N
    binary_str = ""
    
    # Loop through the binary representation of N
    while N > 0
        # Get the last digit of N in binary
        digit = N % 2
        
        # Append it to the binary_str
        binary_str = string(digit) * binary_str
        
        # Remove the last digit from N
        N = N รท 2
    end
    
    # Return the total sum of the digits in binary
    return binary_str
end
```

This function takes an integer `N` and returns a string representing the total sum of its digits in binary. It works by repeatedly finding the last digit of `N` in binary and appending it to an empty string until `N` is zero. The resulting string is then returned.
