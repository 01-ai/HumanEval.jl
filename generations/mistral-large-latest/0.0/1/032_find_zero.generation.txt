Sure, I can help you implement the `find_zero` function in Julia. Given the constraints, we can use the bisection method to find a root of the polynomial. The bisection method requires a continuous function and an interval [a, b] such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. Since the polynomial is continuous and we have an even number of coefficients with a non-zero highest coefficient, we can always find such an interval.

Here's a possible implementation:

```julia
using Roots

function find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})
    @assert length(xs) % 2 == 0 "The number of coefficients must be even"
    @assert xs[end] != 0 "The highest coefficient must be non-zero"

    # Define the polynomial function
    f(x) = sum(coeff * (x^(i - 1)) for (i, coeff) in enumerate(xs))

    # Find an interval [a, b] such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs
    a = 0.0
    b = 1.0
    while f(a) * f(b) >= 0
        b *= 2
    end

    # Use the bisection method to find a root
    root = find_zero(f, a, b)

    return root
end
```

This function first checks that the number of coefficients is even and that the highest coefficient is non-zero. It then defines the polynomial function `f(x)` and finds an interval `[a, b]` such that `f(a)` and `f(b)` have opposite signs. Finally, it uses the `find_zero` function from the `Roots` package to find a root of the polynomial in the interval `[a, b]`.

Please note that this function may not work for all polynomials and it may not always find the root with the highest precision. The bisection method is a simple and robust root-finding method, but it may not be the most efficient or accurate method for all polynomials.

Also, the `find_zero` function from the `Roots` package uses a different method (the secant method) and it may
