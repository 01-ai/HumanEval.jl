```julia
function search(numbers::Vector)::Int
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number
    freq = Dict{Int, Int}()

    # Iterate through the numbers and update the frequency
    for num in numbers
        if haskey(freq, num)
            freq[num] += 1
        else
            freq[num] = 1
        end
    end

    # Find the greatest number with frequency greater than or equal to itself
    max_num = -1
    for (num, freq) in freq
        if freq >= num && num > max_num
            max_num = num
        end
    end

    return max_num
end
```

This function iterates through the numbers and counts the frequency of each number. Then, it finds the greatest number with frequency greater than or equal to itself. If such a number exists, it returns it; otherwise, it returns -1.
