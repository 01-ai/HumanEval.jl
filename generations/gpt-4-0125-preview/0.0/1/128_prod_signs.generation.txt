```julia
function prod_signs(xs::Vector{Int})::Union{Nothing,Int}
    if isempty(xs)
        return nothing
    end

    # Calculate the product of signs
    sign_product = 1
    for x in xs
        if x == 0
            return 0
        elseif x < 0
            sign_product *= -1
        end
    end

    # Calculate the sum of magnitudes
    magnitude_sum = sum(abs.(xs))

    return magnitude_sum * sign_product
end
```

This Julia function `prod_signs` takes a vector of integers as input and returns the sum of the magnitudes of the integers multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array. If the input vector is empty, it returns `nothing`. If any number in the array is 0, the function immediately returns 0, as the product of signs would be 0.
