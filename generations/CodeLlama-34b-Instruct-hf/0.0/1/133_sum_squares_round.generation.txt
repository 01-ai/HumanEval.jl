  Here's an implementation of the `sum_squares_round` function in Julia:
```
function sum_squares_round(xs::Vector)::Int
    return sum(ceil.(xs).^2)
end
```
Explanation:

* `ceil.(xs)` rounds each element in the vector `xs` to the nearest integer towards positive infinity.
* `.^2` squares each element in the vector.
* `sum` calculates the sum of the squared elements.

The function returns an integer value, as specified in the docstring.
