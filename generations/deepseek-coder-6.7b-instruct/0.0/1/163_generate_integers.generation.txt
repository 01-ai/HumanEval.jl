Here is the Julia function that generates the even digits between two given integers:

```julia
function generate_integers(a::Int, b::Int)::Vector{Int}
    if a > b
        a, b = b, a
    end
    return [i for i in a:2:b]
end
```

This function first checks if `a` is greater than `b` and swaps them if so. Then it uses a list comprehension to generate a list of even numbers between `a` and `b`.
