Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function multiply_unit_digits(a::Int, b::Int)::Int
    return abs(a % 10) * abs(b % 10)
end
```

This function works by using the modulus operator (`%`) to get the last digit of each number (the unit digit). The `abs` function is used to ensure that the digits are positive, even if the input numbers are negative. The product of the unit digits is then returned.
