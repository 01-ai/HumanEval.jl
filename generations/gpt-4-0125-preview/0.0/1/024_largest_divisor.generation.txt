To implement the `largest_divisor` function in Julia, we can start by iterating from `n-1` down to 1, checking for the first number that divides `n` evenly. This first such number will be the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n` itself. Here's how you can do it:

```julia
function largest_divisor(n::Int)::Int
    for i in n-1:-1:1
        if n % i == 0
            return i
        end
    end
end

# Example usage
println(largest_divisor(15))  # Expected output: 5
```

This function works by starting from `n-1` and decrementing down to 1, checking if `n` modulo `i` equals 0, which means `i` divides `n` evenly. The first such `i` found is returned as the largest divisor.
