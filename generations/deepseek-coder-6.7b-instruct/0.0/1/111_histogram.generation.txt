Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    words = split(s)
    hist = Dict{String, Int}()
    max_count = 0

    for word in words
        hist[word] = get(hist, word, 0) + 1
        max_count = max(max_count, hist[word])
    end

    most_frequent = Dict{String, Int}()
    for (k, v) in hist
        if v == max_count
            most_frequent[k] = v
        end
    end

    return most_frequent
end
```

This function first splits the input string into words and counts the occurrences of each word using a dictionary. It then finds the maximum count and creates a new dictionary that contains only the words that have this maximum count.
