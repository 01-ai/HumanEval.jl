# Outline

1. Initialize sum and product variables with 0 and 1 respectively.
2. Iterate through the given list of integers.
3. For each integer, add it to the sum and multiply it with the product.
4. After the loop, return a tuple of sum and product.

# Code

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    # Initialize sum and product
    sum_numbers = 0
    product_numbers = 1

    # Iterate through the list of integers
    for number in numbers
        # Add the integer to the sum and multiply it with the product
        sum_numbers += number
        product_numbers *= number
    end

    # Return a tuple of sum and product
    return (sum_numbers, product_numbers)
end
```
