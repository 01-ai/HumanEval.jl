Here is the Julia function that implements the derivative of a polynomial based on the given docstring:

```julia
function derivative(xs::Vector)::Vector
    # Check if the input vector is empty
    if isempty(xs)
        throw(ArgumentError("Input vector cannot be empty"))
    end

    # Calculate the derivative
    deriv = [i * xs[i+1] for i in 1:length(xs)-1]

    return deriv
end
```

This function uses a list comprehension to calculate the derivative of the polynomial. The derivative of a polynomial `a + bx + cx^2 + ...` is `b + 2cx + 3dx^2 + ...`, so we multiply each coefficient by its index (starting from 1) to get the derivative.

You can test this function with the examples provided in the docstring:

```julia
julia> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
4-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  4
 12
 20

julia> derivative([1, 2, 3])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 6
```
