Here is the Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:
```julia
function fizz_buzz(n::Int)
    count = 0
    for i in 1:n-1
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0
            count += sum(digit == '7' for digit in string(i))
        end
    end
    return count
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We initialize a counter `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears.
2. We loop through all integers `i` from 1 to `n-1` (since we're looking for integers less than `n`).
3. For each `i`, we check if it's divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, we proceed to the next step.
4. We convert `i` to a string using the `string()` function, and then use a generator expression to iterate over each character (digit) in the string.
5. We use the `sum()` function to count the number of times the digit '7' appears in the string. We add this count to the overall `count` variable.
6. Finally, we return the total count of 7's.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring to verify that it produces the correct output.
