```julia
function sort_numbers(numbers::String)::String
    # Mapping from word to digit
    word_to_digit = Dict(
        "zero" => 0, "one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3, "four" => 4,
        "five" => 5, "six" => 6, "seven" => 7, "eight" => 8, "nine" => 9
    )
    
    # Split the input string into words
    words = split(numbers)
    
    # Sort the words based on their corresponding numeric value
    sorted_words = sort(words, by = word -> word_to_digit[word])
    
    # Join the sorted words back into a single string
    return join(sorted_words, " ")
end
```

This function first defines a dictionary to map number words to their corresponding numeric values. It then splits the input string into individual words, sorts these words based on their numeric values using the dictionary, and finally joins the sorted words back into a single string to return.
