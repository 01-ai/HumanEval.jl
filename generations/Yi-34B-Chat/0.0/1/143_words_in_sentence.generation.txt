```julia
function words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String
    # Split the sentence into an array of words
    words = split(sentence)
    
    # Filter out words whose length is not prime
    prime_words = filter(word -> isprime(length(word)), words)
    
    # Join the filtered words back into a string
    return join(prime_words)
end
```

This function takes a `String` representing a sentence and returns a `String` containing the words from the original sentence whose lengths are prime numbers, preserving the order of the words.
