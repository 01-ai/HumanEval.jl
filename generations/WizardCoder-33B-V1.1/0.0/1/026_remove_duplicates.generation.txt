Here is the Julia function that implements the doc string:

```julia
function remove_duplicates(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    seen = Set{Int}()
    result = Int[]
    for num in numbers
        if !(num in seen)
            pushfirst(result, num)
            pushfirst(seen, num)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function works by iterating over the input list of numbers. For each number, it checks if it is already in the set of seen numbers. If it is not, it adds it to the result list and to the set of seen numbers. The result list is then returned. The order of elements in the result list is the reverse of the order of their first appearance in the input list. To get the original order, we can use `reverse` function.

```julia
julia> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 2
 1
```

To get the original order, use `reverse` function:

```julia
julia> reverse(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 4
```
