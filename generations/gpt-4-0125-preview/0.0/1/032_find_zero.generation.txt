To implement the `find_zero` function as described, we need to solve the polynomial equation `poly(xs, x) = 0` for `x`. Given the constraints that `find_zero` only works with polynomials with an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient, we can use numerical methods to find a root of the polynomial. One common approach is to use the Newton-Raphson method or other root-finding algorithms available in numerical libraries.

However, Julia does not have a built-in function specifically for finding polynomial roots directly in its standard library, but we can use the `Roots` package to find the roots of a polynomial. If you prefer not to use external packages, a simple implementation using a numerical method like bisection or Newton's method could be provided, but it might not be as efficient or robust for all cases.

Here's how you can implement `find_zero` using the `Roots` package for a more robust solution:

```julia
using Roots

"""
    poly(xs::Vector, x::Float64)

Evaluates polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x`. Return `xs[1] + xs[2] * x + xs[3] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n`.
"""
poly(xs::Vector, x::Float64) = sum(coeff * (x^(i - 1)) for (i, coeff) in enumerate(xs))

"""
    find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})

Finds `x` such that `poly(xs, x) = 0`. Assumes `xs` has an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient, guaranteeing a solution.
"""
function find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})
    # Ensure the polynomial has an even number of coefficients
    if length(xs) % 2 != 0
        error("The polynomial must have an even number of coefficients.")
    end

    # Define the polynomial function based on the coefficients
    p(x) = poly(xs, x)

    # Find a root of the polynomial. This example uses the `find_zero` function from the `Roots` package.
    # Note: This approach finds one root, which might not be the only one.
    root = find_zero(p, (-1000.0, 1000.0)) # You might need to adjust the search interval based on the expected range of roots.

    return root
end
```
