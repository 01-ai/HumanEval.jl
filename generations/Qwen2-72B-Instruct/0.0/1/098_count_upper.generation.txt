```julia
function count_upper(s::String)::Int
    count = 0
    vowels = ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
    for i in 1:2:length(s)
        if s[i] in vowels
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates over the string `s`, checking only the characters at odd indices (using `1:2:length(s)` to step through the string by twos, starting at index 1). It checks if the character at the current index is an uppercase vowel by using the `in` keyword to see if it is contained in the `vowels` array. If it is, the `count` variable is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of uppercase vowels found at odd indices.
