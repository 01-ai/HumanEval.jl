Here is the Julia function implementing the `histogram` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each letter
    freq = Dict{String, Int}()

    # Split the string into words and iterate over them
    for word in split(s)
        # If the word is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if haskey(freq, word)
            freq[word] += 1
        else
            # Otherwise, add the word to the dictionary with count 1
            freq[word] = 1
        end
    end

    # Find the maximum count
    max_count = maximum(values(freq), init=0)

    # Filter the dictionary to only contain words with maximum count
    result = Dict{String, Int}()
    for (word, count) in freq
        if count == max_count
            result[word] = count
        end
    end

    return result
end
```

This function first splits the input string into words (assuming words are space-separated) and then counts the frequency of each word using a dictionary. It then finds the maximum count and filters the dictionary to only contain words with the maximum count.
