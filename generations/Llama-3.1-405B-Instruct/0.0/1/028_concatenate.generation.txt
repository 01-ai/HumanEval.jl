Here is the Julia function that implements the specified behavior:
```julia
"""
    concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String

Concatenate list of strings into a single string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> concatenate(String[])
""

julia> concatenate(["a", "b", "c"])
"abc"
```
"""
function concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String
    return join(xs)
end
```
Explanation:

* The `join` function is a built-in Julia function that concatenates a collection of strings into a single string.
* We simply call `join` on the input vector `xs` and return the result.

Note that this implementation is concise and efficient, as it leverages the optimized `join` function provided by the Julia standard library.
