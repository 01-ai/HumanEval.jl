Here's a solution to the problem:

```julia
function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(s::String)::Bool
    if isempty(s)
        return false
    end
    
    last_char = s[end]
    
    if !isletter(last_char)
        return false
    end
    
    if length(s) == 1
        return true
    end
    
    second_last_char = s[end-1]
    
    if second_last_char == ' '
        return true
    end
    
    return false
end
```

Explanation:

1. We first check if the string `s` is empty. If it is empty, we return `false` since an empty string does not have any characters.

2. We retrieve the last character of the string using `s[end]` and store it in the variable `last_char`.

3. We check if `last_char` is a letter using the `isletter()` function. If it is not a letter, we return `false` since the condition is not satisfied.

4. If the length of the string is 1, it means the string consists of only one character, which is a letter. In this case, we return `true`.

5. If the length of the string is greater than 1, we retrieve the second last character using `s[end-1]` and store it in the variable `second_last_char`.

6. We check if `second_last_char` is a space. If it is a space, it means the last character is a letter and is not part of a word, so we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

This function should correctly handle the given examples and any other string input.
