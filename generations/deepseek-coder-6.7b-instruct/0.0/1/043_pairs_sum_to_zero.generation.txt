Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function pairs_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    set = Set(l)
    for i in l
        if -i in set
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This function works by creating a set from the input list. Then it iterates over the list and checks if the negation of the current element is in the set. If it is, it means that there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, so it returns `true`. If it iterates over the entire list without finding such elements, it returns `false`.
