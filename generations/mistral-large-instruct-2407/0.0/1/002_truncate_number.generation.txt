 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `truncate_number` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    truncate_number(number::Float64)::Float64

Given a positive floating point number, it can be decomposed into integer part
(largest integer smaller than given number) and decimals (leftover part always
smaller than 1). Return the decimal part of the number.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5
```
"""
function truncate_number(number::Float64)::Float64
    return number - floor(number)
end
```

This function works by subtracting the largest integer smaller than the given number (obtained using the `floor` function) from the number itself, which leaves the decimal part.

You can test the function with the provided example:

```julia
julia> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5
```
