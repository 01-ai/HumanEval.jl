To implement the `sort_third` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty array to store the elements at indices divisible by three.
2. Iterate through the input list `l` and for each element at an index `i` (0-based indexing):
   - If `(i + 1) % 3 == 0`, append the element to the array created in step 1.
3. Sort the array containing the elements at indices divisible by three.
4. Create a new list `l_prime` that will store the final result.
5. Iterate through the input list `l` again and for each element at an index `i` (0-based indexing):
   - If `(i + 1) % 3 == 0`, append the next element from the sorted array to `l_prime`.
   - Otherwise, append the current element from `l` to `l_prime`.
6. Return the list `l_prime`.

Now, let's write the code for the `sort_third` function in Julia.
