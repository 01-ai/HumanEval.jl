Here's the implementation of the `double_the_difference` function in Julia:

```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    sum = 0
    for x in xs
        if x isa Int && x > 0 && isodd(x)
            sum += x^2
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates through each element in the input vector `xs`, checks if the element is a positive integer and odd, and if so, adds its square to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum of these squares. If the input list is empty, it returns 0 as specified.
