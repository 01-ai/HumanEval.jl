# Example usage:
# julia> will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)  # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.
# false

# julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)  # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.
# false

# julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)  # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
# true

# julia> will_it_fly([3], 5)  # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
# true
