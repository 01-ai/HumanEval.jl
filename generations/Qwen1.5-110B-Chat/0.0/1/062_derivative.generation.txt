```julia
function derivative(xs::Vector)::Vector
    # Initialize an empty vector for the derivative coefficients
    dxs = Vector{eltype(xs)}(undef, length(xs) - 1)
    
    # Compute the derivative by iterating over the coefficients, excluding the last one
    for i in 1:length(dxs)
        dxs[i] = i * xs[i+1]
    end
    
    return dxs
end
```

This function takes a vector `xs` representing the coefficients of a polynomial, and it returns a new vector representing the derivative of that polynomial. It does this by iterating over the elements of `xs`, multiplying each element (except the first) by its index to get the derivative coefficient, and storing these in a new vector.
