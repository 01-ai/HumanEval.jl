 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `triangle_area` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    triangle_area(a, h)

Given length of a side and height, return the area for a triangle.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```
"""
function triangle_area(a::Number, h::Number)
    return 0.5 * a * h
end
```

This function takes two arguments, `a` (the length of the base) and `h` (the height), and returns the area of the triangle using the formula `0.5 * a * h`. The `::Number` type annotation ensures that both `a` and `h` are numeric values.
