```julia
function search(numbers::Vector)::Int
    counts = Dict()
    for num in numbers
        if num in keys(counts)
            counts[num] += 1
        else
            counts[num] = 1
        end
    end

    for num in sort!(collect(keys(counts)), rev=true)
        if counts[num] >= num
            return num
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```
This Julia function first counts the frequency of each integer in the given vector using a dictionary. Then, it iterates over the sorted keys of the dictionary in descending order, checking if the integer's frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself. If such an integer is found, it is returned. If no such integer exists after checking all, the function returns -1.
