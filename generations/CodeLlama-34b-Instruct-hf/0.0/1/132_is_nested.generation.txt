  Here is a possible implementation of the `is_nested` function in Julia:
```
function is_nested(s::String)::Bool
    # Initialize a stack to keep track of the brackets
    stack = []

    # Iterate through the string
    for c in s
        # If the current character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if c == '['
            push!(stack, c)
        # If the current character is a closing bracket, pop the top element from the stack
        # and check if it is a matching opening bracket
        elseif c == ']'
            if isempty(stack) || stack[end] != '['
                return false
            end
            pop!(stack)
        end
    end

    # If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched brackets
    if !isempty(stack)
        return false
    end

    # If the stack is empty, there are no unmatched brackets
    return true
end
```
This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the top element of the stack is popped and checked to see if it is a matching opening bracket. If the stack is not empty at the end of the iteration, there are unmatched brackets. If the stack is empty, there are no unmatched brackets.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

* `is_nested("[[]]")` returns `true` because the string contains a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.
* `is_nested("[]]]]]]][[[[[]")` returns `false` because the string contains unmatched brackets.
* `is_nested("[][]")` returns `false` because the string contains unmatched brackets.
* `is_nested("[]")` returns `false` because the string contains unmatched brackets.
* `is_nested("[[][]]")` returns `true` because the string contains a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.
* `is_nested("[[]][[")` returns `true` because the string contains a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested.
