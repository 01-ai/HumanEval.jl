The function `car_race_collision(n::Int)::Int` can be implemented as follows:

```julia
function car_race_collision(n::Int)::Int
    return n * (n - 1) � 2
end
```

This function works by calculating the number of pairs of cars that can collide. Since each car can collide with `n - 1` other cars (since it can collide with all the cars except itself), and there are `n` cars, the total number of collisions is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. The `�` operator is used for integer division in Julia.
