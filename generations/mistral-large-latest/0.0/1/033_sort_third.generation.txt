Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Find indices that are divisible by three
    divisible_by_three = findall(x -> x % 3 == 0, 1:length(l))

    # Sort the values at these indices
    sorted_values = sort(l[divisible_by_three])

    # Replace the values at these indices with the sorted values
    for (i, index) in enumerate(divisible_by_three)
        l[index] = sorted_values[i]
    end

    return l
end
```
This function first finds all indices of the input list `l` that are divisible by three. It then sorts the values at these indices. Finally, it replaces the values at these indices with the sorted values and returns the modified list.
