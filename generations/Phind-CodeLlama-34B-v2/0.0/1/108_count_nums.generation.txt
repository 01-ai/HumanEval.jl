Here is the Julia implementation of the `count_nums` function based on the provided docstring:

```julia
function count_nums(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    count = 0
    for x in xs
        if x < 0
            x = -x
        end
        digits = map(d -> parse(Int, d), string(x))
        if sum(digits) > 0
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates over each element in the input vector `xs`. If the element is negative, it converts it to positive. Then it converts each digit of the element into an integer and calculates the sum of all digits. If the sum is greater than 0, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` variable which represents the number of elements with a sum of digits greater than 0.
