To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the array is already sorted. If it is, return `true`.
2. Find the index where a larger number is followed by a smaller number. This is where the array is "rotated".
3. Check if the segment from this index to the end of the array, followed by the start of the array to just before this index, forms a sorted array. If it does, return `true`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, return `false`.

Here's how you can implement this in Julia:

```julia
function move_one_ball(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # Check if the array is empty or already sorted
    if isempty(xs) || issorted(xs)
        return true
    end

    n = length(xs)
    # Find the index where the array is "rotated"
    for i in 1:n-1
        if xs[i] > xs[i+1]
            # Check if the segment from i+1 to the end, followed by the start to i, is sorted
            if issorted(xs[i+1:end]) && issorted(xs[1:i]) && xs[end] <= xs[1]
                return true
            else
                return false
            end
        end
    end

    # If no rotation point is found, the array is not sorted and cannot be sorted by rotation
    return false
end
```

This function first checks if the input array `xs` is empty or already sorted. If not, it looks for the point where the array is "rotated" by finding a pair of elements where the first is greater than the second. Then, it checks if the array can be sorted by rotating at this point. If the array is not sorted and no valid rotation point is found, the function returns `false`.
