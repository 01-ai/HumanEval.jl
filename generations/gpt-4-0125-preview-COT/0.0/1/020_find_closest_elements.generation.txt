### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Sort the list of numbers**: Since we need to find the closest pair, sorting the list will make it easier to compare adjacent elements, which after sorting, are the only candidates for being the closest pair.

2. **Initialize variables**:
   - `min_diff` to store the minimum difference found so far. Initialize it with the maximum possible difference (e.g., the difference between the first and last elements after sorting, or `Inf` for a theoretically infinite difference).
   - `closest_pair` to store the pair of numbers that have the smallest difference found so far.

3. **Iterate through the sorted list**:
   - For each pair of adjacent elements, calculate their difference.
   - If the difference is smaller than the current `min_diff`, update `min_diff` and `closest_pair` with this pair.

4. **Return the `closest_pair`**:
   - Ensure the pair is returned in order (smaller number, larger number), which should naturally be the case if the list was sorted initially.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function find_closest_elements(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Tuple{Float64, Float64}
    # Step 1: Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sort(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize variables
    min_diff = Inf  # Start with an infinitely large difference
    closest_pair = (0.0, 0.0)  # Placeholder for the closest pair
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted list to find the closest pair
    for i in 1:length(sorted_numbers)-1
        current_diff = sorted_numbers[i+1] - sorted_numbers[i]
        if current_diff < min_diff
            min_diff = current_diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i+1])
        end
    end
    
    # Step 4: Return the closest pair
    return closest_pair
end
```

This function first sorts the input vector of numbers to ensure that the closest elements are adjacent. It then iterates through these sorted numbers, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers to find the pair with the smallest difference. This pair is returned as the result.
