Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Define a function `sum_squares_round` that takes a vector `xs` as input and returns an integer.
2. Create a new empty vector `rounded_xs` to store the rounded elements of `xs`.
3. Iterate over each element `x` in `xs`.
4. For each `x`, use the `ceil` function to round `x` to the upper integer, and append the result to `rounded_xs`.
5. After the loop, use the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the squared elements in `rounded_xs`.
6. Return the result.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function sum_squares_round(xs::Vector)::Int
    rounded_xs = Int[]
    for x in xs
        push!(rounded_xs, ceil(Int, x))
    end
    return sum(x^2 for x in rounded_xs)
end
```

This function works by first rounding each element in the input list to the nearest upper integer, then squaring these values and summing them. The use of the `ceil` function ensures that the rounding is always upwards, as required by the problem statement. The `sum` function then calculates the total of these squared values.
