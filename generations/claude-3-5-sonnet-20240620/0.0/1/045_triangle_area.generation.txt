Here's a Julia function that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side (base) and the height:

```julia
function triangle_area(a, h)
    return 0.5 * a * h
end
```

This function implements the formula for the area of a triangle: A = (1/2) * base * height

Let's break down the function:

1. `function triangle_area(a, h)` defines a function named `triangle_area` that takes two parameters:
   - `a`: the length of the base of the triangle
   - `h`: the height of the triangle

2. `return 0.5 * a * h` calculates the area by multiplying the base (`a`) by the height (`h`) and then multiplying the result by 0.5 (which is equivalent to dividing by 2).

3. The result is automatically returned.

This function will work with both integer and floating-point inputs. Julia will automatically promote the result to a floating-point number if necessary.

You can use this function as shown in the example:

```julia
julia> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```

The function is simple and efficient, directly implementing the mathematical formula for the area of a triangle.
