Here's the implementation of the `right_angle_triangle` function in Julia:

```julia
"""
    right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool

Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return `true` if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, `false` otherwise. A right-angled triangle
is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 90 degree.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)
true

julia> right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)
false
```
"""
function right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool
    # Sort the sides to ensure the hypotenuse is the largest side
    sides = sort([a, b, c])
    a, b, c = sides[1], sides[2], sides[3]
    
    # Check if the square of the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
    return c^2 ≈ a^2 + b^2
end
```

This function first sorts the sides of the triangle to ensure that the largest side (hypotenuse) is `c`. It then checks if the Pythagorean theorem holds, i.e., if `c^2` is approximately equal to `a^2 + b^2`. The use of `≈` (approximately equal) accounts for potential floating-point arithmetic issues.
