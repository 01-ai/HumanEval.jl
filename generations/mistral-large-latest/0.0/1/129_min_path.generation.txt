To solve this problem, we can use a brute force approach by generating all possible paths of length `k` and then finding the lexicographically minimum path. However, this approach can be very slow for large grids and large `k`. A more efficient approach is to use dynamic programming to compute the minimum path for each cell and each path length from 1 to `k`.

Here's the Julia implementation of the function:
```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = length(grid)
    @assert N == length(grid[1]) "The grid must be a square."
    @assert allunique([cell for row in grid for cell in row]) "Each integer in the range [1, N * N] must appear exactly once."
    @assert 1 <= k <= N^2 "The path length must be between 1 and N^2."

    # Initialize the dp array to store the minimum path for each cell and each path length.
    dp = fill(typemax(Int), N, N, k)

    # Initialize the first layer of the dp array with the values of the cells.
    for i in 1:N
        for j in 1:N
            dp[i, j, 1] = grid[i][j]
        end
    end

    # Compute the minimum path for each cell and each path length from 2 to k.
    for path_len in 2:k
        for i in 1:N
            for j in 1:N
                # Iterate over the neighbor cells and update the minimum path.
                for (di, dj) in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 1 <= ni <= N && 1 <= nj <= N
                        dp[i, j, path_len] = min(dp[i, j, path_len], dp[ni, nj, path_len - 1] * 10 + grid[i][j])
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
