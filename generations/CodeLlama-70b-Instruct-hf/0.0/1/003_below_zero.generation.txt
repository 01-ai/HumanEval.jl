```julia
function below_zero(operations::Vector{Int})::Bool
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This function iterates through the `operations` vector and adds each element to the `balance` variable. If at any point the `balance` becomes negative, it returns `true`. If the loop finishes without the `balance` becoming negative, it returns `false`.
