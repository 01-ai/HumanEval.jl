Sure, here's the implementation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function in Julia:

```julia
function greatest_common_divisor(a::Int, b::Int)::Int
    while b != 0
        a, b = b, a % b
    end
    return abs(a)
end
```

This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The algorithm repeatedly replaces the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The non-zero number at this point is the GCD. The `abs` function ensures that the result is always non-negative.
