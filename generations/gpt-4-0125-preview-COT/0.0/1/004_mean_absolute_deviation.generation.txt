### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Calculate the Mean**: Compute the mean (average) of the input numbers. This is the sum of all numbers divided by the count of numbers.
2. **Compute Absolute Differences**: For each number in the input list, calculate the absolute difference between that number and the mean. This involves subtracting the mean from each number and taking the absolute value of the result.
3. **Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: Find the average of all absolute differences calculated in the previous step. This is the sum of all absolute differences divided by the count of numbers, which gives us the Mean Absolute Deviation.
4. **Return the MAD**: The final step is to return the calculated Mean Absolute Deviation.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Step 1: Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean_value = sum(numbers) / length(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Compute absolute differences from the mean
    absolute_differences = abs.(numbers .- mean_value)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    mad = sum(absolute_differences) / length(numbers)
    
    # Step 4: Return the MAD
    return mad
end
```

This function first calculates the mean of the given numbers. Then, it computes the absolute differences between each number and the mean. Finally, it calculates the mean of these absolute differences, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation, and returns this value.
