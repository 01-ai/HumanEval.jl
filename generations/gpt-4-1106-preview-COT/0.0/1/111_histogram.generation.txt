### Step-by-step Outline:

1. Define the function `histogram` that takes a string `s` as input.
2. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each letter.
3. Split the string `s` into a list of letters based on spaces.
4. Iterate over each letter in the list:
   - Increment the count of the letter in the dictionary.
5. Find the maximum count of any letter in the dictionary.
6. Create a new dictionary that only includes the letters with the maximum count.
7. Return the new dictionary.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    # Step 2: Initialize an empty dictionary
    letter_counts = Dict{String, Int}()
    
    # Step 3: Split the string into letters
    letters = split(s)
    
    # Step 4: Iterate over each letter and count occurrences
    for letter in letters
        letter_counts[letter] = get(letter_counts, letter, 0) + 1
    end
    
    # Step 5: Find the maximum count
    max_count = maximum(values(letter_counts), init=0)
    
    # Step 6: Filter the dictionary to only include max count letters
    max_count_letters = Dict{String, Int}()
    for (letter, count) in letter_counts
        if count == max_count
            max_count_letters[letter] = count
        end
    end
    
    # Step 7: Return the filtered dictionary
    return max_count_letters
end
```

This function will return a dictionary with the letters that have the most repetitions in the input string, along with their counts. If the input string is empty, it will return an empty dictionary.
