```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Create a copy of the input list
    l_copy = copy(l)

    # Iterate through the list and sort the values at indicies divisible by 3
    for i in 1:3:length(l_copy)
        l_copy[i] = sort(l_copy[i])
    end

    return l_copy
end
```

This function takes a list `l` and returns a list `l_copy` such that `l_copy` is identical to `l` in the indices that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indices that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.
