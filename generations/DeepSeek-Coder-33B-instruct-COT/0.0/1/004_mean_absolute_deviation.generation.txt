Here is a step-by-step outline of how to implement this function:

1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers.
2. For each number in the input list, calculate the absolute difference between the number and the mean.
3. Calculate the mean of these absolute differences.

Here is the Julia code that implements this:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean_numbers = mean(numbers)

    # Calculate the absolute differences between each number and the mean
    abs_diffs = abs.(numbers .- mean_numbers)

    # Calculate the mean of these absolute differences
    mad = mean(abs_diffs)

    return mad
end
```

This function first calculates the mean of the input numbers using the `mean` function. Then it calculates the absolute differences between each number and the mean using the `abs` function and broadcasting (`.`). Finally, it calculates the mean of these absolute differences using the `mean` function again. The result is the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of the input numbers.
