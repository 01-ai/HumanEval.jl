```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets
        if char == '<'
            balance += 1
        elseif char == '>'
            balance -= 1
        end
        if balance < 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return balance == 0
end
```
This Julia function iterates through the input string `brackets`, incrementing a counter for each opening bracket ("<") and decrementing it for each closing bracket (">"). If at any point the counter goes negative, it means there's a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket, so the function returns `false`. If the entire string is processed and the counter is zero, it means all opening brackets have matching closing brackets, so the function returns `true`.
