Here's the implementation of the `correct_bracketing` function in Julia:

```julia
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    balance = 0
    for bracket in brackets
        if bracket == '('
            balance += 1
        elseif bracket == ')'
            balance -= 1
            if balance < 0
                return false
            end
        end
    end
    return balance == 0
end
```

This function iterates through each character in the input string `brackets`. It maintains a `balance` variable to count the number of unmatched opening brackets. For each opening bracket `(`, it increments the `balance`, and for each closing bracket `)`, it decrements the `balance`. If at any point the `balance` becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening ones up to that point, so the function returns `false`. If the loop completes and the `balance` is zero, it means all brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns `true`.
