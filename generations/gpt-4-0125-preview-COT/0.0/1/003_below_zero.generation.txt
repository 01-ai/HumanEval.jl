### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize a variable to keep track of the balance**: Start with a balance of 0 since the account starts with zero balance.

2. **Iterate through the operations list**: Go through each operation in the given list of deposit and withdrawal operations.

3. **Update the balance**: For each operation, update the balance by adding the operation's value to the current balance. This step accounts for both deposits (positive values) and withdrawals (negative values).

4. **Check for negative balance**: After each operation, check if the balance has fallen below zero. If it has, return `true` immediately, as we've detected a point where the account balance is negative.

5. **Return `false` if the loop completes without finding a negative balance**: If the end of the operations list is reached without the balance falling below zero, return `false`.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function below_zero(operations::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # Step 1: Initialize the balance
    balance = 0
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the operations list
    for operation in operations
        # Step 3: Update the balance
        balance += operation
        
        # Step 4: Check for negative balance
        if balance < 0
            return true
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return false if no negative balance was found
    return false
end
```

This function efficiently checks for a negative balance at any point in the sequence of banking operations, returning as soon as such a condition is detected, or confirming that the balance never goes negative after examining all operations.
