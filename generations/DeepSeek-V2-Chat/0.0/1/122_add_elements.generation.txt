Here's the implementation of the `add_elements` function in Julia:

```julia
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:k
        if 10 <= xs[i] < 100 || -100 < xs[i] <= -10
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates over the first `k` elements of the array `xs`, checks if each element has at most two digits (including negative numbers), and adds them to the sum if they do. The constraints ensure that the function will always have a valid input range to work with.
