Here is the Julia function that implements the `intersperse` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function intersperse(numbers::Vector{Int}, delimeter::Int)::Vector{Int}
    result = Int[]
    for i in 1:length(numbers)
        push!(result, numbers[i])
        if i < length(numbers)
            push!(result, delimeter)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function works by iterating over the input `numbers` vector and pushing each number and the `delimeter` to the `result` vector, except for the last number. This ensures that the `delimeter` is not added after the last number.
