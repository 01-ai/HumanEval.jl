Here is the Julia function that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side and the height:

```julia
function triangle_area(a, h)
    return 0.5 * a * h
end
```

This function works by multiplying the length of the side by the height and dividing by 2. This is the formula for the area of a triangle.
