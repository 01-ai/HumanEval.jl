Here is a step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Convert the integer `x` to a string.
2. If `shift` is greater than the length of the string, reverse the string.
3. If `shift` is less than the length of the string, perform a circular shift.
4. Return the result as a string.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function circular_shift(x::Int, shift::Int)::String
    # Convert the integer to a string
    str_x = string(x)

    # If shift is greater than the length of the string, reverse the string
    if shift > length(str_x)
        return str_x[end:-1:1]
    end

    # If shift is less than the length of the string, perform a circular shift
    return str_x[end-shift+1:end] * str_x[1:end-shift]
end
```

This function works by first converting the integer `x` to a string `str_x`. If `shift` is greater than the length of `str_x`, it returns the reversed string. If `shift` is less than the length of `str_x`, it performs a circular shift by slicing the string at the `shift` position and concatenating the two slices in reverse order.
