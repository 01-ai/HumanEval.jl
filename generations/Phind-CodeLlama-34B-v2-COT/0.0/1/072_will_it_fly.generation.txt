To solve this problem, we need to check two conditions:
1. The list `q` is a palindrome (it is the same forwards and backwards).
2. The sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to `w`.

Here is the step-by-step outline of the function:
1. Check if `q` is a palindrome.
2. If `q` is not a palindrome, return `false`.
3. If `q` is a palindrome, check if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`.
4. Return `true` if the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to `w`, and `false` otherwise.

Here is the Julia code for the function:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if q is a palindrome
    if q != reverse(q)
        return false
    end

    # If q is a palindrome, check if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to w
    if sum(q) <= w
        return true
    else
        return false
    end
end
```

This function first checks if `q` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If `q` is not a palindrome, the function immediately returns `false`. If `q` is a palindrome, the function then checks if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`. If the sum is less than or equal to `w`, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
