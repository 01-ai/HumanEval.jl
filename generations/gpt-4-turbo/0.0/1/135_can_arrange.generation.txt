```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Initialize the largest index to -1
    largest_index = -1
    
    # Iterate through the array from the second element to the end
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        # Check if the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous element
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            # Update the largest index
            largest_index = i
        end
    end
    
    # Return the largest index found, or -1 if no such element exists
    return largest_index
end
```

This function iterates through the given vector `xs` starting from the second element. It checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If it is, it updates `largest_index` with the current index. After the loop, it returns the `largest_index` if any such element was found; otherwise, it returns -1.
