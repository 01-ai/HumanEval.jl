```julia
function count_nums(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    count = 0
    for x in xs
        sum_of_digits = sum(digits(x))
        if sum_of_digits > 0
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates through the array `xs` and calculates the sum of digits for each element. If the sum of digits is greater than 0, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` value, which represents the number of elements with a sum of digits greater than 0.
