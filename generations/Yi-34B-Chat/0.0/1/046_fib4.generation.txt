```julia
function fib4(n::Int)::Int
    # Initialize the first four elements of the sequence
    a, b, c, d = 0, 0, 2, 0

    # Loop through the sequence until the n-th element is reached
    for _ in 1:n-3
        # Calculate the next element using the current four elements
        d = a + b + c + d
        # Shift the elements to the left
        a, b, c, d = b, c, d, a
    end

    # Return the n-th element
    return d
end
```

This function defines a loop that iteratively calculates the next element of the `fib4` sequence by adding the current four elements. It does this until the `n-th` element is reached. The loop shifts the elements to the left after each iteration, so that the next iteration can use the current values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
