    min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}

Given a grid with `N` rows and `N` columns (`N >= 2`) and a positive integer
`k`, each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range `[1, N * N]` inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start from
any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells, in other
words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current cell.

Please note that a path of length `k` means visiting exactly `k` cells (not
necessarily distinct).

You CANNOT go off the grid.

A path `A` (of length k) is considered less than a path `B` (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that `A` and `B` go
through (let's call them `lst_A` and `lst_B`), `lst_A` is lexicographically less
than `lst_B`, in other words, there exist an integer index `i` (1 <= i <= k)
such that `lst_A[i] < lst_B[i]` and for any `j` (1 <= j < i) we have `lst_A[j] = lst_B[j]`. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique. Return an ordered list of
the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> min_path([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 1

julia> min_path([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1)
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
```

To implement the `min_path` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `min_path` with the appropriate signature.
2. Initialize a variable to store the minimum path found so far.
3. Create a helper function to explore the grid from a given cell, keeping track of the current path and its length.
4. In the helper function, check if the current path length equals `k`. If so, compare it lexicographically with the minimum path found so far and update the minimum path if necessary.
5. If the current path length is less than `k`, explore all valid neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) that are within the grid boundaries.
6. For each neighbor, recursively call the helper function with the updated path and path length.
7. After exploring all possible paths, return the minimum path found.

Now, let's write the code for the `min_path` function.
