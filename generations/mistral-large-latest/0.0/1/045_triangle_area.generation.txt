Sure, here is the Julia function implementation for calculating the area of a triangle based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    triangle_area(a, h)

Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```
"""
function triangle_area(a::Real, h::Real)
    return 0.5 * a * h
end
```
This function takes two real numbers as arguments, representing the length of a side and the height of the triangle respectively. It calculates the area by multiplying the base (a) and the height (h) and then dividing by 2.
