Sure, here is a Julia function that implements the smallest_change function based on the given docstring:

```julia
function smallest_change(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    n = length(xs)
    if n == 1
        return 0
    end

    # Create a frequency map of elements in the array
    freq_map = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for x in xs
        if haskey(freq_map, x)
            freq_map[x] += 1
        else
            freq_map[x] = 1
        end
    end

    # Count the number of elements that need to be changed
    changes = 0
    for i in 1:div(n, 2)
        if xs[i] != xs[n - i + 1]
            if haskey(freq_map, xs[n - i + 1]) && freq_map[xs[n - i + 1]] > 0
                freq_map[xs[n - i + 1]] -= 1
            elseif haskey(freq_map, xs[i]) && freq_map[xs[i]] > 1
                freq_map[xs[i]] -= 1
            else
                changes += 1
            end
        end
    end

    return changes
end
```

This function first creates a frequency map of the elements in the array. Then it iterates over the first half of the array and checks if the corresponding elements in the second half of the array are the same. If they are not the same, it checks if there is an element in the array that can be changed to make them the same. If such an element is found, it decreases its frequency in the map. If no such element is found, it increments the count of changes. Finally, it returns the count of changes.
