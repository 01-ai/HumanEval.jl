```julia
function how_many_times(s::String, sub_s::String)::Int
    # Initialize count to 0
    count = 0

    # Loop through the original string
    for i in 1:length(s)
        # Check if the substring exists at the current position
        if s[i:i+length(sub_s)-1] == sub_s
            # Increment the count
            count += 1
        end
    end

    return count
end
```

This function takes two strings `s` and `sub_s`, and returns the number of times `sub_s` occurs in `s`, including overlapping occurrences. The examples provided in the docstring demonstrate the expected behavior of the function.
