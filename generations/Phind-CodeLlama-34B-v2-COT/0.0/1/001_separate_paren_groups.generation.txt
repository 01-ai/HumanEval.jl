To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of the parentheses groups. We iterate through the string, and whenever we encounter an open parenthesis, we push it to the stack. When we encounter a closed parenthesis, we pop the top element from the stack and add it to the current group. If the stack becomes empty, it means we have completed a group, so we add it to the result list.

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize an empty stack and an empty result list.
2. Iterate through the string.
3. If the current character is an open parenthesis, push it to the stack.
4. If the current character is a closed parenthesis, pop the top element from the stack and add it to the current group.
5. If the stack becomes empty, it means we have completed a group, so add it to the result list.
6. After iterating through the string, if the stack is not empty, it means there is an unclosed group, so we add the remaining elements in the stack to the current group and add it to the result list.
7. Return the result list.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function separate_paren_groups(paren_string::String)::Vector{String}
    stack = []
    result = []
    group = ""
    for c in paren_string
        if c == '('
            push!(stack, c)
            group *= c
        elseif c == ')'
            pop!(stack)
            group *= c
            if isempty(stack)
                push!(result, group)
                group = ""
            end
        end
    end
    if !isempty(stack)
        group *= join(stack, "")
        push!(result, group)
    end
    return result
end
```

This function works by maintaining a stack of open parentheses and building a string for each group. When a closed parenthesis is encountered, it is appended to the current group and an open parenthesis is popped from the stack. If the stack becomes empty, this means a group has been completed and it is added to the result list. If there are still open parentheses in the stack after iterating through the string, they are appended to the current group.
