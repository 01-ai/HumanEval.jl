To implement the `triples_sum_to_zero` function in Julia, we need to check if there are any three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Iterate through each possible triplet in the list.
2. Check if the sum of the triplet is zero.
3. If such a triplet is found, return `true`.
4. If no such triplet is found after checking all possibilities, return `false`.

Here's the implementation:

```julia
function triples_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    n = length(l)
    if n < 3
        return false
    end
    
    for i in 1:(n-2)
        for j in (i+1):(n-1)
            for k in (j+1):n
                if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0
                    return true
                end
            end
        end
    end
    
    return false
end
```

This function uses three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets in the list. The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^3)\), which is acceptable for small lists but may not be efficient for very large lists. However, it is straightforward and meets the requirements specified in the docstring.

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # false
println(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # true
println(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # false
println(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # true
println(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # false
```

This should produce the expected results as per the examples given in the docstring.
