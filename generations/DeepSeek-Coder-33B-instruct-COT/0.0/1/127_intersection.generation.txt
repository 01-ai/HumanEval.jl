Here is a step-by-step outline of the solution:

1. First, we need to find the intersection of the two intervals. This can be done by finding the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points.

2. Then, we need to calculate the length of the intersection. This is done by subtracting the start point of the intersection from the end point.

3. Finally, we need to check if the length of the intersection is a prime number. This can be done by checking if the length is greater than 1 and if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Here is the Julia code that implements this solution:

```julia
function intersection(interval1::Vector{Int}, interval2::Vector{Int})::String
    # Find the intersection of the two intervals
    start = max(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    end_ = min(interval1[2], interval2[2])

    # If the intervals don't intersect, return "NO"
    if start > end_
        return "NO"
    end

    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    length_ = end_ - start

    # Check if the length of the intersection is a prime number
    if length_ > 1
        for i in 2:sqrt(length_)
            if length_ % i == 0
                return "NO"
            end
        end
        return "YES"
    else
        return "NO"
    end
end
```

This function works by first finding the intersection of the two intervals. If the intervals don't intersect, it returns "NO". Then it calculates the length of the intersection and checks if it is a prime number. If it is, it returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO".
