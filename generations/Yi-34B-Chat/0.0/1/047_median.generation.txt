```julia
function median(l::Vector)
    # Sort the list and find the middle element
    sort!(l)
    n = length(l)
    
    # If the list has an odd number of elements, return the middle element
    if n % 2 == 1
        return l[n รท 2 + 1]
    end
    
    # If the list has an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle elements
    else
        return (l[n รท 2] + l[n รท 2 + 1]) / 2
    end
end
```

This function sorts the given vector `l` using the built-in `sort!` function, which modifies the original array in place. It then finds the median based on the number of elements in the list: if the list has an odd number of elements, it returns the middle element; if the list has an even number of elements, it returns the average of the two middle elements.
