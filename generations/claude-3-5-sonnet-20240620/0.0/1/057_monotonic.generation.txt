Here's a Julia function that implements the `monotonic` behavior as described:

```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    if length(l) <= 1
        return true
    end
    
    increasing = decreasing = true
    
    for i in 2:length(l)
        if l[i] < l[i-1]
            increasing = false
        end
        if l[i] > l[i-1]
            decreasing = false
        end
        if !increasing && !decreasing
            return false
        end
    end
    
    return true
end
```

This function does the following:

1. If the list has 0 or 1 elements, it's considered monotonic by definition, so we return `true`.

2. We initialize two boolean flags: `increasing` and `decreasing`. Both start as `true`.

3. We iterate through the list starting from the second element (index 2 in Julia).

4. For each pair of adjacent elements, we check:
   - If the current element is less than the previous, it's not increasing.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous, it's not decreasing.

5. If at any point we find that the sequence is neither increasing nor decreasing, we return `false`.

6. If we make it through the entire list without returning `false`, the list is monotonic, so we return `true`.

This implementation allows for both strictly monotonic (where each element is strictly greater or less than the previous) and non-strictly monotonic (where adjacent elements can be equal) sequences.

You can test this function with the examples provided:

```julia
println(monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20]))   # true
println(monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10]))  # false
println(monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10]))  # true
```

This function will correctly handle increasing sequences, decreasing sequences, and sequences with equal adjacent elements, returning `true` for monotonic sequences and `false` for non-monotonic ones.
