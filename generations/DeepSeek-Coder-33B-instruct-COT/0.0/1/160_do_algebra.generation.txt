Here is a Julia function that implements the given problem:

```julia
function do_algebra(operator::Vector{String}, operand::Vector{Int})
    # Check if the length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one
    if length(operator) != length(operand) - 1
        error("The length of operator list must be equal to the length of operand list minus one")
    end

    # Check if the operand list has at least two operands
    if length(operand) < 2
        error("The operand list must have at least two operands")
    end

    # Check if the operator list has at least one operator
    if length(operator) < 1
        error("The operator list must have at least one operator")
    end

    # Initialize the result with the first operand
    result = operand[1]

    # Iterate over the rest of the operands and operators
    for i in 2:length(operand)
        # Perform the operation and update the result
        if operator[i-1] == "+"
            result += operand[i]
        elseif operator[i-1] == "-"
            result -= operand[i]
        elseif operator[i-1] == "*"
            result *= operand[i]
        elseif operator[i-1] == "�"
            result �= operand[i]
        elseif operator[i-1] == "^"
            result ^= operand[i]
        else
            error("Invalid operator")
        end
    end

    # Return the result
    return result
end
```

This function first checks if the input lists are valid. If they are not, it throws an error. Then it initializes the result with the first operand. It then iterates over the rest of the operands and operators, performing the corresponding operation and updating the result. Finally, it returns the result.
