 Here's the implementation of the `get_row` function in Julia:

```julia
function get_row(xs::Vector{Vector{Int}}, x::Int)::Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}}
    result = Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}}()
    for (row_index, row) in enumerate(xs)
        for (col_index, value) in enumerate(row)
            if value == x
                push!(result, (row_index, col_index))
            end
        end
    end
    # Sort by rows in ascending order, and by columns in descending order within each row
    sort!(result, by = t -> (t[1], -t[2]))
    return result
end
```

This function iterates through each row and each element within the row to find the occurrences of the integer `x`. It then sorts the coordinates by row in ascending order and by column in descending order within each row.
