Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    binary = string(decimal, base = 2)
    return "db" * binary * "db"
end
```

This function uses the built-in `string` function in Julia to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The `base = 2` argument tells `string` to use base 2 (binary) when converting the number. The `*` operator is used to concatenate the "db" characters to the beginning and end of the binary string.
