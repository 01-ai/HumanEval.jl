To solve the problem of calculating the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving towards each other, we can use a simple mathematical approach. Here's the reasoning:

1. Each car moving left to right will collide with every car moving right to left that it encounters.
2. Since all cars move at the same speed and start from very far away, each car moving left to right will collide with exactly one car moving right to left.
3. Therefore, the total number of collisions is simply the number of cars in one set, which is `n`.

Here's the implementation of the function in Julia:

```julia
function car_race_collision(n::Int)::Int
    return n
end
```

This function takes an integer `n` representing the number of cars in each set and returns the total number of collisions, which is `n`.
