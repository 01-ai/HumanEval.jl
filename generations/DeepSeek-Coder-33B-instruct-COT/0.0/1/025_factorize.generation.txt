Here is a step-by-step outline of the algorithm:

1. Initialize an empty vector to store the factors.
2. Start a loop from 2 to the square root of the input number.
3. In each iteration, check if the current number divides the input number.
4. If it does, divide the input number by the current number and add the current number to the factors vector.
5. Repeat the loop until the input number is 1.
6. Return the factors vector.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above algorithm:

```julia
function factorize(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    factors = Int[]
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n
        if n % i:
            while n % i == 0
                push(factors, i)
                n ï¿½= i
            end
        end
        i += 1
    end
    if n > 1
        push(factors, n)
    end
    return factors
end
```

This function works by continuously dividing the input number by the smallest possible factor (starting from 2) until the number becomes 1. The factors are stored in a vector and returned at the end.
