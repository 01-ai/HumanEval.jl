Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function f(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    result = Vector{Int}(undef, n)
    for i in 1:n
        if i % 2 == 0
            result[i] = factorial(i)
        else
            result[i] = sum(1:i)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 1 to `n`. For each `i`, it checks if `i` is even by using the modulus operator `%`. If `i` is even, it calculates the factorial of `i` using the `factorial` function and stores it in the `i`-th position of the result vector. If `i` is odd, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` using the `sum` function and stores it in the `i`-th position of the result vector. Finally, it returns the result vector.
