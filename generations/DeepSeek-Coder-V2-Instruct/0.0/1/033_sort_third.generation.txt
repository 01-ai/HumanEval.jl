 Here's the implementation of the `sort_third` function in Julia:

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Extract elements at indices divisible by 3
    divisible_by_three = l[3:3:end]
    
    # Sort these elements
    sorted_divisible_by_three = sort(divisible_by_three)
    
    # Create a copy of the original list to modify
    result = copy(l)
    
    # Replace the elements at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted elements
    for (i, idx) in enumerate(3:3:length(l))
        result[idx] = sorted_divisible_by_three[i]
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This function works by first extracting the elements at indices divisible by three, sorting them, and then replacing the original elements at these indices with the sorted ones, while leaving the other elements unchanged.
