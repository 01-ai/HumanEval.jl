### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Define the function `compare` that takes two vectors of integers, `game` and `guess`, as input parameters.
2. Initialize an empty vector `result` that will store the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.
3. Iterate over the indices of the `game` vector using a for loop.
4. For each index, calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.
5. Append the calculated absolute difference to the `result` vector.
6. After the loop, return the `result` vector.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Step 2: Initialize the result vector
    result = Vector{Int}(undef, length(game))
    
    # Step 3: Iterate over the indices of the game vector
    for i in 1:length(game)
        # Step 4: Calculate the absolute difference
        difference = abs(game[i] - guess[i])
        
        # Step 5: Append the difference to the result vector
        result[i] = difference
    end
    
    # Step 6: Return the result vector
    return result
end
```

Now, let's implement the function in Julia.
