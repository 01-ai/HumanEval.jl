Here is the Julia function that implements the given problem:

```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    return [abs(g - s) for (g, s) in zip(guess, game)]
end
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `guess` and `game` vectors simultaneously, and calculates the absolute difference between the corresponding elements. The result is a new vector of the same length as the input vectors.

The `zip` function is used to iterate over the two input vectors simultaneously. The `abs` function is used to calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements.

This function assumes that the input vectors are of the same length. If this is not the case, you may want to add some error checking to handle this situation.
