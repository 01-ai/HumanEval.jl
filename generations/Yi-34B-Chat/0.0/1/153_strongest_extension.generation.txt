```julia
function strongest_extension(class_name::String, extensions::Vector{String})::String
    # Initialize the strongest extension with the first extension in the list
    strongest_ext = extensions[1]
    strongest_str = strength(strongest_ext)

    # Loop through the remaining extensions and update the strongest extension
    # if a stronger one is found
    for ext in extensions[2:end]
        current_str = strength(ext)
        if current_str > strongest_str
            strongest_ext = ext
            strongest_str = current_str
        end
    end

    # Return the class name with the strongest extension
    return "$class_name.$strongest_ext"
end

# Helper function to calculate the strength of an extension
function strength(ext::String)
    # Calculate the strength based on the number of uppercase and lowercase
    # letters in the extension name
    cap = count(x -> isuppercase(x), ext)
    sm = count(x -> islowercase(x), ext)
    return cap - sm
end
```

This function `strongest_extension` takes a class name and a vector of extensions and returns the class name with the strongest extension. The strength of an extension is determined by the difference between the number of uppercase letters and the number of lowercase letters in its name. If there are multiple extensions with the same strength, the one that comes first in the list is chosen.
