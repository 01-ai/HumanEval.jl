Here is a Julia function that implements the `search` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector{Int})::Int
    freqs = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for num in numbers
        if haskey(freqs, num)
            freqs[num] += 1
        else
            freqs[num] = 1
        end
    end

    sorted_keys = sort(collect(keys(freqs)), rev=true)
    for key in sorted_keys
        if freqs[key] >= key
            return key
        end
    end

    return -1
end
```

This function first creates a dictionary `freqs` where the keys are the unique numbers in the input vector `numbers` and the values are the frequencies of these numbers. Then it sorts the keys in descending order and returns the first key that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. If no such key exists, it returns -1.
