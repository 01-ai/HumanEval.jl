```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Calculate the total number of characters in each list
    x_total = sum(length.(xs))
    y_total = sum(length.(ys))

    # If one list has fewer characters, return it
    if x_total < y_total
        return xs
    elseif x_total > y_total
        return ys
    end

    # If the lists have the same number of characters, return the first list
    return xs
end
```

This function calculates the total number of characters in each list of strings and compares them. If one list has fewer characters, it is returned. If both lists have the same number of characters, the first list is returned. If the total number of characters is equal, the first list is returned.
