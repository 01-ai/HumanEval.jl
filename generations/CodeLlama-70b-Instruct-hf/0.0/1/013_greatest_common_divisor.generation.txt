```julia
function greatest_common_divisor(a::Int, b::Int)::Int
    while b != 0
        a, b = b, a % b
    end
    return a
end
```

This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. It iteratively calculates the remainder of `a` divided by `b` and assigns it to `b`. The loop continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` is the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and `b`.
