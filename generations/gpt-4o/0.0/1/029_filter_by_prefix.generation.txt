Sure, here is the implementation of the `filter_by_prefix` function in Julia:

```julia
function filter_by_prefix(xs::Vector{String}, prefix::String)::Vector{String}
    return filter(x -> startswith(x, prefix), xs)
end
```

This function uses the `filter` function along with an anonymous function `x -> startswith(x, prefix)` to filter the input list `xs` for strings that start with the given `prefix`.

Here are the examples provided in the docstring to verify the function:

```julia
julia> filter_by_prefix(String[], "a")
String[]

julia> filter_by_prefix(["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"], "a")
2-element Vector{String}:
 "abc"
 "array"
```

You can test the function with these examples to ensure it works as expected.
