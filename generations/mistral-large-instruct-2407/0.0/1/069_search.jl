"""
    search(numbers::Vector)::Int

You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer
that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the
value of the integer itself. The frequency of an integer is the number of times
it appears in the list. If no such a value exist, return -1.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1])
2

julia> search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4])
3

julia> search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4])
