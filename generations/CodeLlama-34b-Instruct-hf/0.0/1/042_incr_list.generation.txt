  Here is an implementation of the `incr_list` function in Julia:
```
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    return [x + 1 for x in xs]
end
```
This function takes a vector `xs` as input and returns a new vector with each element incremented by 1. The `for` loop is used to iterate over the elements of `xs` and the `+` operator is used to increment each element.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
```
julia> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 4

julia> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
9-element Vector{Int64}:
   6
   4
   6
   3
   4
   4
  10
   1
 124
```
