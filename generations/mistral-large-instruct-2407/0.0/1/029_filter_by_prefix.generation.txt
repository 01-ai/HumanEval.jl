 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `filter_by_prefix` function in Julia based on the provided docstring:

```julia
"""
    filter_by_prefix(xs::Vector{String}, prefix::String)::Vector{String}

Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> filter_by_prefix(String[], "a")
String[]

julia> filter_by_prefix(["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"], "a")
2-element Vector{String}:
 "abc"
 "array"
```
"""
function filter_by_prefix(xs::Vector{String}, prefix::String)::Vector{String}
    return filter(x -> startswith(x, prefix), xs)
end
```

This function uses the `filter` function along with the `startswith` function to filter the input list of strings based on the given prefix. The `filter` function iterates over the elements of the input vector `xs` and includes only those elements that satisfy the condition specified by the anonymous function `x -> startswith(x, prefix)`.
