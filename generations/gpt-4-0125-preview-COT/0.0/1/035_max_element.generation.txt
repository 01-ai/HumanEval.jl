### Outline for `max_element` Function

1. **Initialize** a variable to store the maximum value. Since we're looking for the maximum element in a list, we can initially set this to the first element of the list, assuming the list is not empty.
2. **Iterate** through each element in the list.
    - For each element, **compare** it with the current maximum value.
    - If the current element is **greater** than the current maximum, **update** the maximum value to this current element.
3. **Return** the maximum value after iterating through the entire list.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function max_element(xs)
    # Step 1: Initialize the maximum value to the first element of the list
    max_val = xs[1]
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through each element in the list
    for x in xs
        # If the current element is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum
        if x > max_val
            max_val = x
        end
    end
    
    # Step 3: Return the maximum value
    return max_val
end
```

This function assumes that the input list `xs` is not empty. If there's a possibility of receiving an empty list, additional error handling should be implemented to manage such cases appropriately.
