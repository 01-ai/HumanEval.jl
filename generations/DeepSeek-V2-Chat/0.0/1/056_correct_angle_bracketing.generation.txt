Here's the implementation of the `correct_angle_bracketing` function in Julia:

```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets
        if char == '<'
            balance += 1
        elseif char == '>'
            balance -= 1
        end
        if balance < 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return balance == 0
end
```

This function iterates through each character in the input string `brackets`. It maintains a `balance` variable to count the difference between the number of opening and closing brackets. If at any point the balance goes negative (indicating more closing brackets than opening ones), it returns `false`. If the loop completes and the balance is zero, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
