```julia
function sort_numbers(numbers::String)::String
    # Split the input string into a vector of numbers
    numbers_vec = split(numbers, " ")
    
    # Sort the vector of numbers
    sorted_numbers_vec = sort(numbers_vec)
    
    # Join the sorted numbers back into a string
    sorted_numbers_str = join(sorted_numbers_vec, " ")
    
    return sorted_numbers_str
end
```

This function takes a string `numbers` containing space-delimited numbers from "zero" to "nine" and returns the string with those numbers sorted from smallest to largest. The function first splits the input string into a vector of numbers, then sorts the vector, and finally joins the sorted numbers back into a string.
