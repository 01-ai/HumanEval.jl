Here's a solution to the problem in Julia:

```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    binary = reverse(bitstring(decimal))
    return "db$(binary)db"
end
```

Explanation:

1. The `bitstring()` function in Julia converts an integer to its binary representation as a string. However, it returns the binary representation in reverse order (least significant bit first).

2. We use the `reverse()` function to reverse the binary string obtained from `bitstring()`, so that it is in the correct order (most significant bit first).

3. We concatenate the reversed binary string with the prefix "db" and the suffix "db" using string interpolation `$()`. This adds the extra characters at the beginning and end of the binary string as required.

4. Finally, we return the resulting string.

Here are some example outputs:

```jldoctest
julia> decimal_to_binary(0)
"db0db"

julia> decimal_to_binary(1)
"db1db"

julia> decimal_to_binary(10)
"db1010db"

julia> decimal_to_binary(15)
"db1111db"
```

The solution uses built-in Julia functions to convert the decimal number to its binary representation and format it according to the specified requirements.
