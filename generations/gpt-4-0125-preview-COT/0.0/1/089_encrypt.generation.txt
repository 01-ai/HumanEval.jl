### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Define the function**: Start by defining the `encrypt` function that takes a single string argument.

2. **Create a mapping for the alphabet**: Since we need to rotate the alphabet, it's useful to have a mapping that allows us to easily find the corresponding encrypted character for each letter in the input string. The rotation is by 2 * 2 = 4 places down the alphabet.

3. **Handle both lowercase and uppercase letters**: The function should be able to encrypt both lowercase and uppercase letters while preserving their case.

4. **Encrypt the input string**:
    - Iterate through each character in the input string.
    - For each character, check if it is a letter. If it is not a letter, append it to the result string as it is.
    - If it is a letter, find its encrypted counterpart using the mapping created in step 2, taking care to preserve the case (uppercase or lowercase).
    - Append the encrypted character to the result string.

5. **Return the encrypted string**: After processing all characters in the input string, return the result string as the encrypted message.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function encrypt(s::String)
    # Define the alphabet and the rotation factor
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    rotation_factor = 4
    encrypted_message = []

    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in s
        # Check if the character is a letter
        if isletter(char)
            # Determine if the character is uppercase to preserve case
            is_upper = isuppercase(char)
            char = lowercase(char)  # Convert to lowercase for mapping

            # Find the index of the character in the alphabet
            index = findfirst(isequal(char), alphabet)

            # Calculate the new index after rotation
            new_index = (index + rotation_factor - 1) % length(alphabet) + 1

            # Get the encrypted character
            encrypted_char = alphabet[new_index]

            # Convert back to uppercase if necessary
            if is_upper
                encrypted_char = uppercase(encrypted_char)
            end

            # Append the encrypted character to the result
            push!(encrypted_message, encrypted_char)
        else
            # If not a letter, append the character as it is
            push!(encrypted_message, char)
        end
    end

    # Return the encrypted message as a string
    return join(encrypted_message)
end
```
