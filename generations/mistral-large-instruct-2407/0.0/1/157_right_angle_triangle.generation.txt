 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `right_angle_triangle` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool

Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return `true` if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, `false` otherwise. A right-angled triangle
is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 90 degree.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)
true

julia> right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)
false
```
"""
function right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool
    # Sort the sides to ensure c is the longest side
    sides = sort([a, b, c])
    a, b, c = sides[1], sides[2], sides[3]

    # Check if the sides form a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem
    return isapprox(a^2 + b^2, c^2, atol=1e-10)
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting the Sides**: The function first sorts the sides to ensure that `c` is the longest side. This is necessary because the Pythagorean theorem requires the hypotenuse to be the longest side.
2. **Pythagorean Theorem**: The function then checks if the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides (`a` and `b`) is approximately equal to the square of the longest side (`c`). The `isapprox` function is used to handle floating-point precision issues.

### Examples:
- `right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)` returns `true` because \(3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\).
- `right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)` returns `false` because \(1^2 + 2^2 \neq 3^2\).

You can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.
