Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function reverse_delete(s::String, c::String)::Tuple{String, Bool}
    s = filter(x -> !(x in c), s)
    return (s, s == reverse(s))
end
```

This function works by first filtering out all characters in `s` that are in `c`. Then it checks if the resulting string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If they are the same, it returns the string and `true`, otherwise it returns the string and `false`.
