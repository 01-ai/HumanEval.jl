Here is a Julia function that implements the `histogram` function as described in the docstring:
```julia
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    # Split the input string into individual letters
    letters = split(s, " ")
    
    # Create an empty dictionary to store the letter counts
    counts = Dict{String, Int}()
    
    # Iterate over each letter and update the count in the dictionary
    for letter in letters
        if haskey(counts, letter)
            counts[letter] += 1
        else
            counts[letter] = 1
        end
    end
    
    # Find the maximum count
    max_count = maximum(values(counts), init=0)
    
    # Filter the dictionary to only include letters with the maximum count
    result = filter((k, v) -> v == max_count, counts)
    
    return result
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We first split the input string into individual letters using the `split` function.
2. We create an empty dictionary `counts` to store the letter counts.
3. We iterate over each letter and update the count in the dictionary using the `haskey` function to check if the letter is already in the dictionary.
4. We find the maximum count using the `maximum` function with the `init` argument set to 0 to handle the case where the input string is empty.
5. We filter the dictionary to only include letters with the maximum count using the `filter` function.
6. Finally, we return the resulting dictionary.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring to verify that it produces the correct output.
