Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    # Return sorted unique common elements for two lists
    intersect(l1, l2) |> sort |> unique
end
```

This function uses the `intersect` function to find common elements, `sort` to sort them, and `unique` to ensure they are unique.
