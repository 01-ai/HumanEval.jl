To implement the `fix_spaces` function as described, we can follow these steps:

1. Replace all occurrences of two or more spaces with a hyphen `-`.
2. Replace all remaining single spaces with underscores `_`.

Here's how you can do it in Julia:

```julia
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # Step 1: Replace two or more spaces with a hyphen
    s = replace(s, r"\s{2,}" => "-")
    
    # Step 2: Replace remaining single spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")
    
    return s
end
```

This function uses regular expressions to identify patterns in the string `s`. The `r"\s{2,}"` pattern matches any sequence of two or more whitespace characters (spaces in this context), and replaces them with a hyphen `-`. Then, any remaining single spaces are replaced with underscores `_`.
