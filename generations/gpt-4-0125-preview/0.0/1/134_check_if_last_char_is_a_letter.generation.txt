To implement the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function as described, we need to perform a few checks:

1. Ensure the string is not empty.
2. Check if the last character is an alphabetical character.
3. Ensure the last character is not part of a word, which implies it should be followed by a space or be the very last character in the string without any trailing spaces.

Given the description, there seems to be a contradiction in the requirement that the last character must be an alphabetical character and not part of a word. Based on the examples provided, it appears the intent is to check if the last non-space character is an alphabetical character, and it is part of a word (since a character not part of a word would imply it's standalone, not followed by a space, which contradicts the examples).

Assuming the goal is to check if the last non-space character is an alphabetical character and it is part of a word, here's how you could implement it:

```julia
function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(s::String)::Bool
    # Trim any trailing spaces from the string
    trimmed_s = rstrip(s)
    
    # Check if the trimmed string is empty
    if isempty(trimmed_s)
        return false
    end
    
    # Get the last character of the trimmed string
    last_char = last(trimmed_s)
    
    # Check if the last character is an alphabetical character
    return isletter(last_char)
end
```

This implementation trims trailing spaces, checks if the resulting string is empty, and then checks if the last character of the non-empty, trimmed string is an alphabetical character. This should meet the requirements based on the examples provided.
