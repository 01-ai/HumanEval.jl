### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Input Validation**: Check if the input `n` is greater than 0. If not, return an error or a specific value indicating invalid input.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize a variable to hold the result of the special factorial calculation. Since the result can be very large, use `BigInt` for the result variable to avoid integer overflow.
3. **Calculation**:
   - Loop from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - For each iteration `i`, calculate the factorial of `i` and multiply it with the result variable.
   - Use a helper function or an in-built Julia function to calculate the factorial to keep the code clean and modular.
4. **Return the Result**: After the loop ends, return the result variable which now holds the special factorial of `n`.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
# Helper function to calculate factorial
function factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    result = BigInt(1)
    for i in 1:n
        result *= i
    end
    return result
end

# Main function to calculate the special (Brazilian) factorial
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    # Input validation
    if n <= 0
        throw(ArgumentError("Input must be greater than 0"))
    end
    
    # Initialization
    special_fact = BigInt(1)
    
    # Calculation
    for i in 1:n
        special_fact *= factorial(i)
    end
    
    # Return the result
    return special_fact
end

# Example usage
println(special_factorial(4))  # Expected output: 288
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps, ensuring that the function is modular by separating the factorial calculation into its helper function. This approach not only makes the code more readable but also allows for easier debugging and potential reuse of the `factorial` function elsewhere in the codebase.
