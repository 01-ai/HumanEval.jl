```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector)
    # Initialize an empty vector to store positive numbers
    positives = Vector{Int64}()

    # Iterate over the list and add positive numbers to the new vector
    for x in xs
        if x > 0
            push!(positives, x)
        end
    end

    # Return the new vector with only positive numbers
    return positives
end
