Here is a Julia function that implements the encryption as described in the docstring:

```julia
function encrypt(s::String)
    encrypted = ""
    for char in s
        if isletter(char)
            shift = 2 * 2
            base = isuppercase(char) ? 'A' : 'a'
            encrypted_char = base + (char - base + shift) % 26
            encrypted *= encrypted_char
        else
            encrypted *= char
        end
    end
    return encrypted
end
```

This function goes through each character in the input string. If the character is a letter, it calculates the encrypted character by shifting it down by 4 places (2 multiplied by 2) in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. Non-letter characters are left unchanged. The encrypted characters are then concatenated to form the final encrypted string.
