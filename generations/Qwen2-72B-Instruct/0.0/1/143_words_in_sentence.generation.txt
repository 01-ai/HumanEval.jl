```julia
using Primes

"""
    words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String

Return a string that contains the words from the original sentence, whose lengths are prime numbers.
The order of the words in the new string should be the same as the original one.
"""
function words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = split(sentence)
    
    # Filter words whose lengths are prime numbers
    prime_length_words = filter(word -> isprime(length(word)), words)
    
    # Join the filtered words back into a string
    return join(prime_length_words, " ")

Note: This solution uses the `Primes` package for checking if a number is prime. If the package is not already installed, it can be added by running `]add Primes` in the Julia REPL.
