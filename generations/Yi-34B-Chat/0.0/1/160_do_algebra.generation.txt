This function `do_algebra` takes two lists, `operator` and `operand`, and uses them to build an algebraic expression. It then evaluates the expression and returns the result. The function checks that the length of `operator` is one less than the length of `operand`, that `operand` contains only non-negative integers, and that `operator` is not empty and `operand` has at least two operands. It then iterates through the `operator` list and performs the corresponding operation on the `operand` list, updating the result at each step.
