Here's the implementation of the `do_algebra` function in Julia:

```julia
function do_algebra(operator::Vector{String}, operand::Vector{Int})
    # Start with the first operand
    result = operand[1]
    
    # Iterate over the operators and operands to build and evaluate the expression
    for i in 1:length(operator)
        op = operator[i]
        num = operand[i + 1]
        
        if op == "+"
            result += num
        elseif op == "-"
            result -= num
        elseif op == "*"
            result *= num
        elseif op == "รท"
            result = div(result, num)
        elseif op == "^"
            result = result ^ num
        else
            error("Unsupported operator: $op")
        end
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This function iterates through the operators and operands, applying each operation in sequence to build and evaluate the algebraic expression. The `div` function is used for floor division, and exponentiation is handled with the `^` operator.
