Here is the Julia function that implements the `same_chars` function based on the given docstring:

```julia
function same_chars(s0::String, s1::String)::Bool
    return sort(collect(s0)) == sort(collect(s1))
end
```

This function works by first converting each string `s0` and `s1` into a vector of characters, then sorting these vectors. If the sorted vectors are equal, it means that `s0` and `s1` have the same characters, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
