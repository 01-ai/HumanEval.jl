```julia
function sorted_list_sum(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths
    even_length_strings = filter(x -> length(x) % 2 == 0, xs)
    # Sort the list by length of each word, then alphabetically for equal lengths
    sorted_list = sort(even_length_strings, by = x -> (length(x), x))
    return sorted_list
end
```
This function first filters out the strings with odd lengths using the `filter` function. Then, it sorts the resulting list by the length of each word using the `sort` function. If two words have the same length, it sorts them alphabetically. The sorted list is then returned.
