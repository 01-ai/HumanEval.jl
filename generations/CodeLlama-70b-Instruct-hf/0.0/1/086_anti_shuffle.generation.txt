```julia
function anti_shuffle(s::String)::String
    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)

    # Sort each word and join them back into a string
    sorted_words = join([join(sort(word), "") for word in words])

    # Replace the original words with sorted words
    sorted_s = replace(s, Regex("\\S+") => sorted_words)

    return sorted_s
end
```

This function first splits the input string into words using the `split` function. Then, it sorts each word using the `sort` function and joins them back into a string using the `join` function. Finally, it replaces the original words with the sorted words using the `replace` function.
