```

This function takes a `String` message and returns an `String` with the following transformations applied to each character:

1. Swap the case of the character (uppercase becomes lowercase, and vice versa).
2. If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), replace it with the letter that appears 2 places after it in the English alphabet (a -> c, e -> g, i -> k, o -> q, u -> s).

The function assumes that the input message contains only letters.
