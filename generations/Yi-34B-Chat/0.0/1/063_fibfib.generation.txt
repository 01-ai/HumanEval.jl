```julia
function fibfib(n::Int)::Int
    # Base cases
    if n == 0
        return 0
    elseif n == 1
        return 0
    elseif n == 2
        return 1
    end

    # Recursive case
    return fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)
end
```

This function defines the `fibfib` function that calculates the n-th element of the Fibonacci-like sequence known as the FibFib sequence. The function starts by checking for the base cases where the sequence is defined directly: `fibfib(0)`, `fibfib(1)`, and `fibfib(2)`. For all other values of `n`, it uses a recursive approach to calculate the sequence by calling itself with the three preceding values.
