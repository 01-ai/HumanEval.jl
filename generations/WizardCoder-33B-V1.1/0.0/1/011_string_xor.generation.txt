Here is the Julia function that performs the XOR operation on two binary strings:

```julia
function string_xor(a::String, b::String)::String
    if length(a) != length(b)
        throw(ArgumentError("Input strings must be of the same length."))
    end

    result = ""
    for i in 1:length(a)
        if a[i] == b[i]
            result *= "0"
        else
            result *= "1"
        end
    end

    return result
end
```

This function first checks if the input strings are of the same length. If not, it throws an `ArgumentError`. Then it iterates over each character in the strings, and if the characters are the same, it appends "0" to the result string, otherwise it appends "1". The result string is then returned.
