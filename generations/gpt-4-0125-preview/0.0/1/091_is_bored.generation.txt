To implement the `is_bored` function as described, we can follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into sentences based on the delimiters '.', '?', and '!'.
2. Trim whitespace from the beginning and end of each sentence to ensure accurate comparison.
3. Check if a sentence starts with "I" or "I " to account for both cases where "I" is immediately followed by another word or is a standalone sentence.
4. Count the number of sentences that meet the criteria of starting with "I".
5. Return the count.

Here's how the implementation might look in Julia:

```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences based on '.', '?', and '!'
    sentences = split(s, r"[.?!]")
    
    # Initialize a counter for boredom sentences
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Trim whitespace from the sentence
        trimmed_sentence = strip(sentence)
        
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I" or "I "
        if startswith(trimmed_sentence, "I ") || trimmed_sentence == "I"
            # Increment the boredom count
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end
    
    return boredom_count
end
```

This function first splits the input string into sentences using a regular expression that matches '.', '?', and '!'. It then iterates through each sentence, trims any leading or trailing whitespace, and checks if the sentence starts with "I" or "I ". If it does, the boredom count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of boredom sentences.
