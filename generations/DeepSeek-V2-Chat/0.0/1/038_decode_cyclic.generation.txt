To implement the `decode_cyclic` function, we need to reverse the encoding process done by `encode_cyclic`. The `encode_cyclic` function cycles groups of three characters by rearranging them as `x[2] * x[3] * x[1]`. Therefore, to decode, we need to reverse this process by rearranging each group of three characters back to their original order.

Here's the implementation of the `decode_cyclic` function:

```julia
function decode_cyclic(s::String)::String
    join((x[3] * x[1] * x[2] for x in Iterators.partition(s, 3)))
end
```

This function works as follows:
1. It partitions the input string `s` into groups of three characters using `Iterators.partition(s, 3)`.
2. For each group of three characters `x`, it rearranges them back to their original order `x[3] * x[1] * x[2]`.
3. It joins these rearranged groups back into a single string using `join`.

This ensures that the encoded string is correctly decoded back to its original form.
