### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing a variable to store the largest index where the condition is met. Let's call it `largest_index` and initialize it to `-1` to handle the case where no such element exists.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Loop through the array starting from the second element (index 1) to the end. We start from the second element because we need to compare each element with its predecessor.

3. **Check Condition**: For each element, check if it is not greater than or equal to the element immediately before it. This means we are looking for an element that is strictly less than its predecessor.

4. **Update Largest Index**: If the condition is met, update `largest_index` with the current index. Since we are iterating from the beginning to the end, this will ensure `largest_index` holds the largest possible index where the condition is true.

5. **Return Result**: After the loop finishes, return `largest_index`. If no such element was found, this will return `-1` as initialized.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Step 1: Initialize the variable to store the largest index
    largest_index = -1
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        # Step 3: Check if the current element is strictly less than its predecessor
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            # Step 4: Update the largest index where the condition is met
            largest_index = i
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return largest_index
end
```

This function iterates through the given vector `xs` and efficiently finds the largest index where an element is not greater than or equal to its predecessor, fulfilling the requirements specified in the doc string.
