Here's the implementation of the `sort_third` function in Julia:

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Create a copy of the input list
    result = copy(l)
    
    # Iterate over the indices that are divisible by three
    for i in 1:3:length(l)
        # Sort the elements at these indices
        result[i:min(i+2, length(l))] = sort(result[i:min(i+2, length(l))])
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This function works by first creating a copy of the input list to avoid modifying the original list. It then iterates over the indices that are divisible by three and sorts the elements at these indices. The `min` function is used to ensure that we do not go out of bounds when the list length is not a multiple of three.
