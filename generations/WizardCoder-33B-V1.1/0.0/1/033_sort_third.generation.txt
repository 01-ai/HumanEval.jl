Here is the Julia function that implements the above doc string:

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    third_elements = [l[i] for i in 1:3:length(l)]
    sort(third_elements)
    sorted_l = copy(l)
    j = 1
    for i in 1:3:length(l)
        sorted_l[i] = third_elements[j]
        j += 1
    end
    return sorted_l
end
```

This function works by first creating a list of the elements at the indices divisible by three, sorting this list, and then replacing the elements at the indices divisible by three in the original list with the sorted elements.
