 Here's the implementation of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function in Julia:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    mean_value = mean(numbers)
    absolute_deviations = abs.(numbers .- mean_value)
    return mean(absolute_deviations)
end
```

This function calculates the mean absolute deviation as described:
1. It computes the mean of the input vector `numbers`.
2. It calculates the absolute difference between each element in `numbers` and the mean.
3. It returns the mean of these absolute differences.

Here's how you can use this function:

```julia
julia> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```
