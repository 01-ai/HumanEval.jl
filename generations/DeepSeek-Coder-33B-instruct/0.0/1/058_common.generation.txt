Here is the Julia function that implements the doc string:

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    return sort(unique(intersect(l1, l2)))
end
```

This function works by first finding the intersection of the two input vectors (`intersect(l1, l2)`), which gives a vector of elements that are common to both. Then, it removes any duplicates from this intersection (`unique(...)`), and finally sorts the result (`sort(...)`).

You can test this function with the examples provided in the doc string:

```julia
julia> common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
   1
   5
 653

julia> common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
```
