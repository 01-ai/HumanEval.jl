Certainly! Below is the Julia function `is_prime` that checks if a given number is prime.

```julia
function is_prime(n::Int)
    if n <= 1
        return false
    elseif n <= 3
        return true
    elseif n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0
        return false
    end
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n
        if n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0
            return false
        end
        i += 6
    end
    return true
end
```

This function first handles the simple cases:
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
- If `n` is 2 or 3, it is prime.
- If `n` is divisible by 2 or 3, it is not prime.

Then, it checks for factors beyond 3 by iterating from 5 onwards, incrementing by 6 each time (since any prime number greater than 3 can be written in the form of 6k Â± 1). If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime. The loop runs while `i * i <= n` to avoid unnecessary checks beyond the square root of `n`, as any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.

This is an efficient way to check for primality for relatively small numbers.
