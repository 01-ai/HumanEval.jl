To implement the `factorize` function in Julia, we need to find the prime factors of a given integer `n` and return them in a vector. Here's how we can do it:

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
2. Divide `n` by the current prime number as long as it is divisible.
3. Move to the next prime number and repeat the process until `n` becomes 1.
4. Collect all the prime factors in a vector and return it.

Here's the implementation:

```julia
function factorize(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    factors = Int[]
    divisor = 2
    
    while n > 1
        while n % divisor == 0
            push!(factors, divisor)
            n = div(n, divisor)
        end
        divisor += 1
    end
    
    return factors
end
```

Let's break down the function:

- We initialize an empty vector `factors` to store the prime factors.
- We start with the smallest prime number, `divisor = 2`.
- We use a `while` loop to keep dividing `n` by the current `divisor` as long as `n` is divisible by `divisor`.
- If `n` is no longer divisible by `divisor`, we increment `divisor` to check the next potential prime factor.
- This process continues until `n` is reduced to 1.
- Finally, we return the vector `factors` containing all the prime factors of the original `n`.

Here are the examples provided in the docstring to test the function:

```julia
julia> factorize(8)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 2
 2

julia> factorize(25)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 5

julia> factorize(70)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 5
 7
```

This implementation should work correctly for any positive integer `n`.
