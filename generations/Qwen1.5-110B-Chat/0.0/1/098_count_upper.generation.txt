```julia
function count_upper(s::String)::Int
    uppercase_vowels = "AEIOU"
    count = 0
    for i in 1:2:length(s)
        if s[i] âˆˆ uppercase_vowels
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This Julia function `count_upper` takes a string `s` as input and counts the number of uppercase vowels located at odd indices within the string. It iterates through the string, checking every other character (odd indices), and increments the `count` variable whenever an uppercase vowel is found. Finally, it returns the total count of such vowels.
