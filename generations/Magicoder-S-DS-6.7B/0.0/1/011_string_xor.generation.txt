Here is a Julia function that performs the XOR operation on two binary strings:

```julia
function string_xor(a::String, b::String)::String
    if length(a) != length(b)
        error("Input strings must be of the same length")
    end

    result = ""
    for i in 1:length(a)
        if a[i] == b[i]
            result *= "0"
        else
            result *= "1"
        end
    end

    return result
end
```

This function first checks if the two input strings are of the same length. If they are not, it throws an error. Then, it iterates over each character in the strings, performing a XOR operation on the corresponding characters and appending the result to the `result` string. If the characters are the same, it appends `0` to the `result` string, otherwise it appends `1`. Finally, it returns the `result` string.

You can test this function with the provided example:

```julia
julia> string_xor("010", "110")
"100"
```
