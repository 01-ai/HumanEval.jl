  Here is a possible implementation of the `min_path` function in Julia:
```
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Initialize the minimum path to be the first cell
    min_path = [grid[1][1]]
    # Initialize the current cell to be the first cell
    current_cell = grid[1][1]
    # Initialize the number of steps to be taken to 0
    num_steps = 0

    while num_steps < k
        # Get the neighbors of the current cell
        neighbors = get_neighbors(grid, current_cell)
        # Find the neighbor with the minimum value
        min_neighbor = minimum(neighbors)
        # Add the minimum neighbor to the minimum path
        min_path = [min_path; min_neighbor]
        # Update the current cell to be the minimum neighbor
        current_cell = min_neighbor
        # Increment the number of steps
        num_steps += 1
    end

    return min_path
end

# Function to get the neighbors of a cell
function get_neighbors(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, cell::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Get the row and column of the cell
    row, col = cell
    # Initialize the neighbors to be an empty vector
    neighbors = Vector{Int}()

    # Check the neighbors in the same row
    for i in 1:size(grid, 1)
        if i != row && grid[i][col] != 0
            push!(neighbors, grid[i][col])
        end
    end

    # Check the neighbors in the same column
    for j in 1:size(grid, 2)
        if j != col && grid[row][j] != 0
            push!(neighbors, grid[row][j])
        end
    end

    return neighbors
end
```
This implementation uses a greedy approach to find the minimum path. It starts at the first cell and repeatedly chooses the neighbor with the minimum value until the path has length `k`. The `get_neighbors` function is used to get the neighbors of a cell in the grid.

Here is an example usage of the `min_path` function:
```
julia> grid = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
3Ã—3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6
 7  8  9

julia> min_path(grid, 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 1
```
This returns the minimum path of length 3, which is `[1, 2, 1]`.
