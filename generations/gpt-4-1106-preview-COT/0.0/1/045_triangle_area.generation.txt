To implement the `triangle_area` function in Julia, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: `a` (the length of a side) and `h` (the height of the triangle).
2. Calculate the area of the triangle using the formula: area = (a * h) / 2.
3. Return the calculated area.

Now, let's write the code for the function:

```julia
"""
    triangle_area(a, h)

Given length of a side and height, return area for a triangle.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```
"""
function triangle_area(a, h)
    # Calculate the area of the triangle
    area = (a * h) / 2
    return area
end
```

You can now test this function with the provided example or other values to ensure it works correctly.
