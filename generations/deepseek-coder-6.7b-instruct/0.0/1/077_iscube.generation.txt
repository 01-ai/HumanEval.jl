Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function iscube(a::Int)::Bool
    x = round(Int, cbrt(abs(a)))
    return x^3 == abs(a)
end
```

This function works by first taking the cube root of the absolute value of the input number `a`, rounding it to the nearest integer, and then checking if this integer cubed is equal to the absolute value of `a`. If it is, then `a` is a cube of some integer, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

The `cbrt` function is used to calculate the cube root, and `round` is used to round the result to the nearest integer. The `abs` function is used to handle negative numbers by taking their absolute value first.
