```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    # Initialize an empty vector to hold the incremented list
    incremented_xs = Vector{Int64}()
    
    # Iterate over the original list and increment each element by 1
    for x in xs
        push!(incremented_xs, x + 1)
    end
    
    # Return the incremented list
    return incremented_xs
end
```

This function takes a vector `xs` of integers and returns a new vector where each element is incremented by 1. The `jldoctest` block demonstrates the expected output for several input vectors.
