```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    # Initialize counters for opening and closing brackets
    open_brackets = 0
    close_brackets = 0

    # Iterate over the string and count the brackets
    for char in brackets
        if char == '<'
            open_brackets += 1
        elseif char == '>'
            close_brackets += 1
        end

        # If the number of opening brackets is not equal to the number of closing brackets,
        # the bracketting is incorrect
        if open_brackets != close_brackets
            return false
        end
    end

    # If we reach the end of the string without encountering an unmatched bracket,
    # the bracketting is correct
    return open_brackets == close_brackets
end
```

This function works by keeping track of the number of opening and closing brackets in the string. If the number of opening brackets is not equal to the number of closing brackets at any point, the function returns `false`. If the function reaches the end of the string without finding an unmatched bracket, it returns `true`.
