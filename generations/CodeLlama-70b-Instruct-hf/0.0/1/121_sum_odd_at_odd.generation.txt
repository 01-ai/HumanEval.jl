```julia
function sum_odd_at_odd(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0

    # Iterate through the vector
    for i in 1:2:length(xs)
        # Check if the element at the current index is odd
        if xs[i] % 2 == 1
            # If it is odd, add it to the sum
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end

    # Return the sum
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates through the vector, skipping every other element. For each element, it checks if it is odd. If it is, it adds it to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.
