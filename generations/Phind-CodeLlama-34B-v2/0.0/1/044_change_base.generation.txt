Here is the Julia implementation of the `change_base` function:

```julia
function change_base(x::Int, base::Int)::String
    digits = "0123456789"
    result = ""
    while x > 0
        result = digits[x % base + 1] * result
        x = div(x, base)
    end
    return result
end
```

This function works by repeatedly dividing the input number `x` by the desired `base`, and collecting the remainder in the `result` string. The remainder is converted to the corresponding digit in the `digits` string. The process continues until `x` becomes 0. The resulting string is the base-`base` representation of the input number.
