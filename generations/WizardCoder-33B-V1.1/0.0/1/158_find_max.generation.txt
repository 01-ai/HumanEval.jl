Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function find_max(words::Vector{String})::String
    max_unique_chars = 0
    max_word = ""
    for word in words
        unique_chars = length(unique(word))
        if unique_chars > max_unique_chars
            max_unique_chars = unique_chars
            max_word = word
        elseif unique_chars == max_unique_chars
            max_word = min(max_word, word)
        end
    end
    return max_word
end
```

This function iterates over each word in the input list. For each word, it calculates the number of unique characters and compares it with the maximum number of unique characters found so far. If the number of unique characters in the current word is greater than the maximum, it updates the maximum and the corresponding word. If the number of unique characters is equal to the maximum, it compares the current word with the maximum word lexicographically and updates the maximum word if the current word is smaller. Finally, it returns the word with maximum number of unique characters.
