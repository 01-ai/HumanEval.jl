Certainly! Below is the Julia function `sum_to_n` that sums numbers from `1` to `n`:

```julia
"""
    sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int

`sum_to_n` is a function that sums numbers from `1` to `n`.
"""
function sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
end

# Examples
println(sum_to_n(30))  # Output: 465
println(sum_to_n(100)) # Output: 5050
println(sum_to_n(5))   # Output: 15
println(sum_to_n(10))  # Output: 55
println(sum_to_n(1))   # Output: 1
```

This function uses the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. The `//` operator is used to perform integer division, ensuring that the result is an integer.
