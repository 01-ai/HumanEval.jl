 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `triples_sum_to_zero` function in Julia:

```julia
"""
    triples_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool

Takes a list of integers as an input. It returns `true` if there are three
distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
false

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
true

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
false

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
true

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
false
```
"""
function triples_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    n = length(l)
    if n < 3
        return false
    end

    sort!(l)

    for i in 1:(n-2)
        if l[i] > 0
            break
        end
        left = i + 1
        right = n
        while left < right
            sum = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]
            if sum == 0
                return true
            elseif sum < 0
                left += 1
            else
                right -= 1
            end
        end
    end

    return false
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the length of the list is less than 3. If so, it returns `false` because it's impossible to find three distinct elements.
2. **Sorting**: The list is sorted to facilitate the two-pointer technique.
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each element of the list.
   - If the current element is greater than zero, the loop breaks because the remaining elements will also be positive and cannot sum to zero.
   - Two pointers, `left` and `right`, are used to find pairs that sum to the negative of the current element.
   - If the sum of the three elements is zero, the function returns `true`.
   - If the sum is less than zero, the `left` pointer is incremented to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than zero, the `right` pointer is decremented to decrease the sum.
4. **Return**: If no such triplet is found, the function returns `false`.

This approach ensures that the function runs efficiently with a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the list.
