 Here's the implementation of the `double_the_difference` function in Julia:

```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    sum(x^2 for x in xs if isinteger(x) && x > 0 && isodd(x))
end
```

This function uses a generator expression to filter and square the odd, positive integers in the input vector `xs`, and then sums them up. If the input list is empty or contains no valid numbers, it will return 0.
