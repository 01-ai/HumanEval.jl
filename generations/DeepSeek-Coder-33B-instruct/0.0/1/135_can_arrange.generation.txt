Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            return i - 1
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```

This function iterates over the given vector `xs` from the second element to the end. If it finds an element that is less than the previous one, it returns the index of the previous element (since Julia is 1-indexed, we subtract 1 from `i`). If it doesn't find such an element, it returns -1.
