Here is the implementation of the `incr_list` function in Julia:

```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector{T}) where T<:Number
    return [x + 1 for x in xs]
end
```

This function takes a vector `xs` as input and returns a new vector with each element incremented by 1. The list comprehension `[x + 1 for x in xs]` is used to create the new vector. The type parameter `T<:Number` ensures that the function works for vectors of any numeric type.
