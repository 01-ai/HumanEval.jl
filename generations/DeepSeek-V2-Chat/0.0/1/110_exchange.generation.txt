Here's the implementation of the `exchange` function in Julia:

```julia
function exchange(lst1::Vector{Int}, lst2::Vector{Int})::String
    # Count the number of odd elements in lst1
    odd_count_lst1 = count(x -> x % 2 != 0, lst1)
    
    # Count the number of even elements in lst2
    even_count_lst2 = count(x -> x % 2 == 0, lst2)
    
    # Check if the number of odd elements in lst1 can be replaced by even elements from lst2
    if odd_count_lst1 <= even_count_lst2
        return "YES"
    else
        return "NO"
    end
end
```

This function works by counting the number of odd elements in `lst1` and the number of even elements in `lst2`. If the number of odd elements in `lst1` is less than or equal to the number of even elements in `lst2`, it is possible to exchange elements to make all elements in `lst1` even, so it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".
