To calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side and the height, you can use the formula:

Area = (base * height) / 2

Here's the implementation of the `triangle_area` function in Julia:

```julia
function triangle_area(a, h)
    return (a * h) / 2
end
```

Explanation:
- The function `triangle_area` takes two parameters: `a` representing the length of a side (base) and `h` representing the height of the triangle.
- Inside the function, we use the formula `(a * h) / 2` to calculate the area of the triangle.
- The calculated area is then returned as the result of the function.

You can use the function like this:

```julia
julia> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```

In this example, the length of the side (base) is 5 and the height is 3. The function calculates the area using the formula `(5 * 3) / 2`, which evaluates to `7.5`.

The function will work with any valid numeric values for the base and height of the triangle.
