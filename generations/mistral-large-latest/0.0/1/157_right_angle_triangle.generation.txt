Sure, here is the Julia function that implements the right_angle_triangle function based on the given docstring:

```julia
function right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool
    """
    right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool

    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return `true` if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, `false` otherwise. A right-angled triangle
    is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 90 degree.

    # Examples

    ```jldoctest
    julia> right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)
    true

    julia> right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)
    false
    ```
    """
    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle
    if a + b <= c || b + c <= a || c + a <= b
        return false
    end

    # Check if the triangle is right-angled
    if a^2 + b^2 == c^2 || b^2 + c^2 == a^2 || c^2 + a^2 == b^2
        return true
    else
        return false
    end
end
```
This function first checks if the given sides form a valid triangle by ensuring that the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. Then it checks if the triangle is right-angled by using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
