Here is the Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:
```julia
function closest_integer(value::String)::Int
    num = parse(Float64, value)
    if num >= 0
        return ceil(Int, num - 0.5) + 1
    else
        return floor(Int, num + 0.5) - 1
    end
end
```
However, the above code has some issues. Here is the correct version:
```julia
function closest_integer(value::String)::Int
    num = parse(Float64, value)
    if num >= 0
        return round(Int, num, RoundNearestTiesAway)
    else
        return round(Int, num, RoundNearestTiesAway)
    end
end
```
Or more simply:
```julia
function closest_integer(value::String)::Int
    num = parse(Float64, value)
    return round(Int, num, RoundNearestTiesAway)
end
```
This function uses the `round` function with the `RoundNearestTiesAway` rounding mode, which rounds ties away from zero. This ensures that the function behaves as described in the docstring. 

Note that the `parse` function is used to convert the input string to a `Float64` number, and the `round` function is used to round this number to the nearest integer. The `RoundNearestTiesAway` rounding mode is used to ensure that ties are rounded away from zero. 

You can test this function with the examples provided in the docstring to see that it produces the correct results.
