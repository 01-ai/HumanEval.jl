Here is a step-by-step outline of how to solve this problem:

1. Create a new list `l'` that is a copy of `l`.
2. Extract the elements at the even indices of `l`.
3. Sort these elements.
4. Replace the elements at the even indices of `l'` with the sorted elements.
5. Return `l'`.

Here is the Julia code that implements this outline:

```julia
function sort_even(l::Vector)::Vector
    l′ = copy(l)
    even_elements = l[2:2:end]
    sort_even_elements = sort(even_elements)
    l′[2:2:end] = sort_even_elements
    return l′
end
```

This function works by first creating a copy of the input list `l`. It then extracts the elements at the even indices of `l`, sorts them, and replaces the elements at the even indices of `l'` with the sorted elements. Finally, it returns `l'`.
