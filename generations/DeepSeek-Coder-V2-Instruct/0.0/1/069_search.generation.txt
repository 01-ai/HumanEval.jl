 Here's the implementation of the `search` function in Julia based on the provided doc string:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each number
    freq = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for num in numbers
        if haskey(freq, num)
            freq[num] += 1
        else
            freq[num] = 1
        end
    end

    # Initialize the result to -1 (default if no such number is found)
    result = -1

    # Iterate through the dictionary to find the greatest integer
    # that meets the criteria
    for (num, count) in freq
        if count >= num && (result == -1 || num > result)
            result = num
        end
    end

    return result
end
```

This function first counts the frequency of each number in the list using a dictionary. Then, it iterates through the dictionary to find the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. If no such integer is found, it returns `-1`.
