  Here's an implementation of the `decimal_to_binary` function in Julia:
```
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    # Convert the decimal number to a binary string
    binary_string = string(decimal, base=2)

    # Add the extra 'db' characters at the beginning and end of the string
    binary_string = "db" * binary_string * "db"

    return binary_string
end
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. The `string` function is used to convert the decimal number to a binary string. The `base=2` argument specifies that the number should be converted to binary.
2. The `binary_string` variable is initialized to the result of the `string` function.
3. The `binary_string` variable is then modified by adding the extra 'db' characters at the beginning and end of the string using string concatenation.
4. The modified `binary_string` variable is returned as the result of the function.

Here's an example of how to use the `decimal_to_binary` function:
```
julia> decimal_to_binary(15)
"db1111db"
```
This will return the binary representation of the decimal number 15, which is "db1111db".
