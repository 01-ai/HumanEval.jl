### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize an empty vector** to store the differences between the game scores and the guesses.
2. **Iterate through the game scores and guesses simultaneously** using a loop.
   - For each pair of score and guess, calculate the absolute difference.
   - Append the absolute difference to the vector initialized in step 1.
3. **Return the vector** containing the differences.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty vector for differences
    differences = Vector{Int}(undef, length(game))
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the game scores and guesses
    for i in 1:length(game)
        # Calculate the absolute difference and store it
        differences[i] = abs(game[i] - guess[i])
    end
    
    # Step 3: Return the vector of differences
    return differences
end

# Example usage
println(compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2]))
println(compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2]))
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps to calculate the absolute differences between the game scores and the guesses, storing and returning them in a vector as specified.
