Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    return sum(x for x in xs[1:k] if x < 100)
end
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the first `k` elements of `xs` and adds up the elements that are less than 100. The `sum` function is used to add up the elements.
