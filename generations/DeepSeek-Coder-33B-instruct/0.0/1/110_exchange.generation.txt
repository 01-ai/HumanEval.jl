Here is a Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function exchange(lst1::Vector{Int}, lst2::Vector{Int})::String
    odd_lst1 = count(isodd, lst1)
    even_lst2 = count(iseven, lst2)
    if odd_lst1 <= even_lst2
        return "YES"
    else
        return "NO"
    end
end
```

This function works by counting the number of odd numbers in `lst1` and the number of even numbers in `lst2`. If the number of odd numbers in `lst1` is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in `lst2`, it is possible to exchange elements between the two lists to make all the elements of `lst1` to be even. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is how you can test the function:

```julia
println(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # "YES"
println(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # "NO"
```
