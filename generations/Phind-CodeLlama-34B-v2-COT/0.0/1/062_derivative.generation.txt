# Outline

1. Initialize an empty vector to store the coefficients of the derivative.
2. Iterate through the input vector starting from the second element (since the derivative of a constant is 0).
3. For each element, multiply it by its index and add it to the derivative coefficients vector.
4. Return the derivative coefficients vector.

# Code

```julia
function derivative(xs::Vector)::Vector
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the coefficients of the derivative
    derivative_coefficients = similar(xs, length(xs) - 1)

    # Iterate through the input vector starting from the second element
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        # For each element, multiply it by its index and add it to the derivative coefficients vector
        derivative_coefficients[i - 1] = xs[i] * i
    end

    # Return the derivative coefficients vector
    return derivative_coefficients
end
