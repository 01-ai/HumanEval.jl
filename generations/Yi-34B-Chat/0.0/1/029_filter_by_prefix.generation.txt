```julia
function filter_by_prefix(xs::Vector{String}, prefix::String)::Vector{String}
    # Initialize an empty vector to hold the filtered strings
    filtered_xs = Vector{String}()

    # Iterate over the input vector of strings
    for x in xs
        # Check if the string starts with the given prefix
        if startswith(x, prefix)
            # If so, add it to the filtered vector
            push!(filtered_xs, x)
        end
    end

    # Return the filtered vector of strings
    return filtered_xs
end
```

This function takes in a vector of strings `xs` and a prefix `prefix`, and returns a vector containing only the strings from `xs` that start with `prefix`. If no strings in `xs` start with `prefix`, an empty vector is returned.
