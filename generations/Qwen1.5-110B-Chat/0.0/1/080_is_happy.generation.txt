```julia
function is_happy(s::String)::Bool
    length(s) < 3 && return false
    for i in 1:(length(s) - 2)
        if s[i] == s[i+1] || s[i] == s[i+2] || s[i+1] == s[i+2]
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```
This Julia function `is_happy` takes a string `s` as input and checks if it meets the criteria for being "happy". It iterates through the string, checking every set of three consecutive characters to ensure they are all distinct. If any set of three characters contains duplicate letters, the function returns `false`. If it completes the check without finding duplicates, it returns `true`, indicating the string is happy.
