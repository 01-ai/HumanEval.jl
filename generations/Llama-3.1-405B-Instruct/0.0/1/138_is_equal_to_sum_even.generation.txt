Here is a Julia function that implements the logic described in the docstring:

```julia
"""
    is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int)::Bool

Evaluate whether the given number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4
positive even numbers.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> is_equal_to_sum_even(4)
false

julia> is_equal_to_sum_even(6)
false

julia> is_equal_to_sum_even(8)
true
```
"""
function is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int)::Bool
    # If n is less than 8, it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers
    if n < 8
        return false
    end
    
    # If n is not divisible by 2, it cannot be written as the sum of even numbers
    if n % 2 != 0
        return false
    end
    
    # Try all possible combinations of 4 even numbers that sum up to n
    for i in 2:2:(n-6)
        for j in 2:2:(n-i-4)
            for k in 2:2:(n-i-j-2)
                l = n - i - j - k
                if l % 2 == 0 && l > 0
                    return true
                end
            end
        end
    end
    
    # If no combination is found, return false
    return false
end
```

However, this solution has a time complexity of O(n^3) due to the nested loops, which can be inefficient for large inputs. A more efficient solution can be achieved by using a mathematical approach.

Since we are looking for 4 even numbers that sum up to `n`, we can divide `n` by 2 and look for 4 numbers that sum up to `n/2`. This is equivalent to finding 4 numbers that sum up to `n/2 - 4` and then adding 2 to each number.

Here is a more efficient Julia function:

```julia
function is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int)::Bool
    if n < 8 || n % 2 != 0
        return false
    end
    
    n_div_2 = n รท 2
    return n_div_2 >= 8
end
```

This function simply checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 and if `n` is divisible by 2. If both conditions are true, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. This solution has a time complexity of O(1), making it much more efficient than the previous solution.
