### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Check if the list is a palindrome**: A list is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. This can be done by comparing the list with its reverse. If they are the same, the list is palindromic.

2. **Calculate the sum of the elements in the list**: Iterate through the list and sum up all the elements. This will be used to check against the maximum possible weight `w`.

3. **Compare the sum with the maximum possible weight**: If the sum of the elements is less than or equal to `w`, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, return `false`.

4. **Return `true` if the list is palindromic and the sum is within the weight limit**: If both conditions are met, the function should return `true`. If either condition is not met, return `false`.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Step 1: Check if the list is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = q == reverse(q)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the sum of the elements in the list
    sum_of_elements = sum(q)
    
    # Step 3 & 4: Compare the sum with the maximum possible weight and check if it's a palindrome
    return is_palindrome && sum_of_elements <= w
end
```

This function first checks if the list `q` is palindromic by comparing it with its reverse. Then, it calculates the sum of the elements in `q`. Finally, it returns `true` if the list is palindromic and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`, otherwise it returns `false`.
