  Here's one way to implement the `correct_angle_bracketing` function in Julia:
```
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    # Initialize a stack to keep track of the opening brackets
    stack = []

    # Iterate through the string of brackets
    for bracket in brackets
        # If the current bracket is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
        if bracket == '<'
            push!(stack, bracket)
        # If the current bracket is a closing bracket, pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack
        elseif bracket == '>'
            if isempty(stack)
                return false
            end
            pop!(stack)
        end
    end

    # If the stack is empty, all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket
    return isempty(stack)
end
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. We initialize a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
2. We iterate through the string of brackets, one by one.
3. If the current bracket is an opening bracket (`<`), we push it onto the stack.
4. If the current bracket is a closing bracket (`>`), we pop the corresponding opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no corresponding opening bracket, so we return `false`.
5. If the stack is empty after iterating through all the brackets, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so we return `true`.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

* If the input is `"<"`, the stack will be `[<]` after the first iteration. Since the stack is not empty after iterating through all the brackets, we return `false`.
* If the input is `"<>"` or `"<<><>>"`, the stack will be empty after iterating through all the brackets, so we return `true`.
* If the input is `"><<>"` or `"<><<>>"`, the stack will not be empty after iterating through all the brackets, so we return `false`.
