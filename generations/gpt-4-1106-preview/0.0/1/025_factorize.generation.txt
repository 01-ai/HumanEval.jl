Certainly! Below is the Julia function `factorize` that returns the prime factors of a given integer `n` as specified in the doc string:

```julia
function factorize(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    factors = Vector{Int}()
    # Handle the case of 0 and 1, which have no prime factors
    if n < 2
        return factors
    end
    # Extract factors of 2
    while n % 2 == 0
        push!(factors, 2)
        n = div(n, 2)
    end
    # Extract factors of odd numbers starting from 3
    factor = 3
    while factor * factor <= n
        while n % factor == 0
            push!(factors, factor)
            n = div(n, factor)
        end
        factor += 2
    end
    # If n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2
        push!(factors, n)
    end
    return factors
end
```

You can use this function in Julia to factorize integers as shown in the examples.
