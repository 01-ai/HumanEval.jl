 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `choose_num` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    choose_num(x::Int, y::Int)::Int

This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the biggest even
integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If there's no such number,
then the function should return -1.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> choose_num(12, 15)
14

julia> choose_num(13, 12)
-1
```
"""
function choose_num(x::Int, y::Int)::Int
    # Ensure x is less than or equal to y
    if x > y
        return -1
    end

    # Iterate from y down to x to find the largest even number
    for num in y:-1:x
        if iseven(num)
            return num
        end
    end

    # If no even number is found, return -1
    return -1
end
```

This function first checks if `x` is greater than `y`, in which case it returns `-1` because the range is invalid. Then, it iterates from `y` down to `x` to find the largest even number within the range. If an even number is found, it is returned; otherwise, `-1` is returned.
