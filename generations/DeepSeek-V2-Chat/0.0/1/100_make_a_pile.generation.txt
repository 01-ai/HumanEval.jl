Here's the implementation of the `make_a_pile` function in Julia:

```julia
function make_a_pile(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    pile = Vector{Int}(undef, n)
    pile[1] = n
    for i in 2:n
        if pile[i-1] % 2 == 0
            pile[i] = pile[i-1] + 2
        else
            pile[i] = pile[i-1] + 2
        end
    end
    return pile
end
```

This function initializes a vector `pile` with `n` elements. It starts by setting the first element to `n`. Then, for each subsequent level, it checks if the previous level had an even or odd number of stones and adds 2 to get the next number in the sequence, either odd or even.
