Here is the implementation of the `correct_bracketing` function in Julia:

```julia
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets
        if bracket == '('
            push!(stack, bracket)
        elseif bracket == ')'
            if isempty(stack)
                return false
            else
                pop!(stack)
            end
        end
    end
    return isempty(stack)
end
```

This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. Whenever an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. If a closing bracket is encountered, it is checked if the stack is empty or not. If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns `false`. Otherwise, the topmost opening bracket is popped from the stack. Finally, the function checks if the stack is empty or not. If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
