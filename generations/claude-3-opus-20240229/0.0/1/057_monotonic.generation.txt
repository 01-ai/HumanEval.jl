Here's the implementation of the `monotonic` function in Julia:

```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    n = length(l)
    if n <= 1
        return true
    end
    
    is_increasing = l[1] <= l[2]
    
    for i in 2:n-1
        if is_increasing
            if l[i] > l[i+1]
                return false
            end
        else
            if l[i] < l[i+1]
                return false
            end
        end
    end
    
    return true
end
```

Explanation:

1. We first check the length of the input vector `l`. If it has 0 or 1 elements, it is considered monotonic by definition, so we return `true`.

2. We determine whether the list is potentially increasing or decreasing by comparing the first two elements. If `l[1] <= l[2]`, we assume it is increasing; otherwise, we assume it is decreasing.

3. We iterate over the vector starting from the second element up to the second-to-last element.

4. Inside the loop, we check if the current element and the next element satisfy the monotonic condition based on whether the list is increasing or decreasing.
   - If `is_increasing` is `true`, we check if `l[i] <= l[i+1]`. If this condition is violated, we return `false` since the list is not monotonically increasing.
   - If `is_increasing` is `false`, we check if `l[i] >= l[i+1]`. If this condition is violated, we return `false` since the list is not monotonically decreasing.

5. If we reach the end of the loop without returning `false`, it means the list is monotonic, so we return `true`.

The function correctly handles the examples provided in the docstring:

```jldoctest
julia> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
true

julia> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
false

julia> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
true
```

The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input vector, as we iterate over the vector once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space.
