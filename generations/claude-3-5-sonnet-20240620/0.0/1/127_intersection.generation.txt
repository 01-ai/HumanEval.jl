To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the intersection of the two intervals
2. Calculate the length of the intersection
3. Check if the length is a prime number
4. Return the appropriate result

Here's a Julia function that implements this logic:

```julia
function intersection(interval1::Vector{Int}, interval2::Vector{Int})::String
    # Find the intersection
    start = max(interval1[1], interval2[1])
    end_ = min(interval1[2], interval2[2])
    
    # Check if there's no intersection
    if start > end_
        return "NO"
    end
    
    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    length = end_ - start + 1
    
    # Check if the length is prime
    if is_prime(length)
        return "YES"
    else
        return "NO"
    end
end

# Helper function to check if a number is prime
function is_prime(n::Int)::Bool
    if n <= 1
        return false
    end
    for i in 2:isqrt(n)
        if n % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

Let's break down the `intersection` function:

1. We find the start of the intersection by taking the maximum of the two start points, and the end of the intersection by taking the minimum of the two end points.

2. If the start is greater than the end, it means there's no intersection, so we return "NO".

3. We calculate the length of the intersection. We add 1 because the intervals are closed (inclusive of both start and end).

4. We use a helper function `is_prime` to check if the length is a prime number.

5. We return "YES" if the length is prime, and "NO" otherwise.

The `is_prime` function is a simple primality test that checks divisibility up to the square root of the number.

This implementation should correctly handle all the example cases:

```julia
julia> intersection([1, 2], [2, 3])
"NO"

julia> intersection([-1, 1], [0, 4])
"NO"

julia> intersection([-3, -1], [-5, 5])
"YES"
```

In the first case, the intersection is [2, 2], which has length 1 (not prime).
In the second case, the intersection is [0, 1], which has length 2 (not prime).
In the third case, the intersection is [-3, -1], which has length 3 (prime).
