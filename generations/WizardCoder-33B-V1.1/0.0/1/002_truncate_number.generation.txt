Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function truncate_number(number::Float64)::Float64
    return number - floor(number)
end
```

This function works by subtracting the largest integer smaller than the given number from the given number. The `floor` function is used to get the largest integer smaller than the given number. The result is the decimal part of the number.
