### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize a sum variable**: Start with a variable to keep track of the sum of ASCII codes of uppercase characters found in the string.

2. **Iterate through each character in the string**: Go through each character in the input string to check if it is an uppercase character.

3. **Check if a character is uppercase**: For each character, determine if it is an uppercase letter. In ASCII, uppercase letters range from 65 ('A') to 90 ('Z'). Alternatively, you can use the built-in `isuppercase` function in Julia.

4. **Add ASCII value if uppercase**: If the character is uppercase, add its ASCII value to the sum. You can use the `Int` function to get the ASCII value of a character.

5. **Return the sum**: After iterating through all characters, return the sum.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function digitSum(s::String)::Int
    # Step 1: Initialize sum variable
    sum = 0
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s
        # Step 3 & 4: Check if a character is uppercase and add its ASCII value to sum
        if isuppercase(char)
            sum += Int(char)
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return the sum
    return sum
end
```

This function should work as expected based on the provided examples. It iterates through the string, checks for uppercase characters, and sums their ASCII values.
