```julia
function sort_array_based_on_head_tail(xs::Vector{Int})
    # Check if the array is empty or has only one element
    if length(xs) <= 1
        return copy(xs)
    end

    # Determine the sorting order based on the sum of the first and last elements
    is_odd = (xs[1] + xs[end]) % 2 != 0

    # Create a copy of the array to avoid modifying the original array
    sorted_xs = copy(xs)

    # Sort the array in ascending or descending order based on the determined sorting order
    if is_odd
        sort!(sorted_xs)
    else
        sort!(sorted_xs, rev=true)
    end

    return sorted_xs
end
```

This function first checks if the input array is empty or has only one element, in which case it simply returns a copy of the array. Then, it determines the sorting order based on whether the sum of the first and last elements is odd or even. It creates a copy of the input array to avoid modifying the original array and sorts the copy in the determined order. Finally, it returns the sorted copy of the array.
