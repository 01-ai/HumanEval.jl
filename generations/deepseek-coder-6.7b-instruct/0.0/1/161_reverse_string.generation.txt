Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function reverse_string(s::String)::String
    if !any(isletter, s)
        return reverse(s)
    end
    return join([isletter(c) ? (islowercase(c) ? uppercase(c) : lowercase(c)) : c for c in s])
end
```

This function uses the `isletter` function to check if a character is a letter. If the string contains no letters, it reverses the string. If the string contains letters, it iterates over the string and checks if each character is a letter. If it is, it changes the case of the letter from lower to upper or vise versa. If it is not a letter, it keeps the character as it is. The resulting array of characters is then joined back into a string.
