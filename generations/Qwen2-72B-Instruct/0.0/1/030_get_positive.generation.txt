Here is the Julia function that implements the functionality described in the docstring:

```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector)
    return filter(x -> x > 0, xs)
end
```

This function uses the `filter` function from Julia's standard library to return a new array containing only the elements of `xs` that satisfy the condition `x > 0`.
