Sure, here is the implementation of the `sum_product` function in Julia:

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    sum = 0
    product = 1
    
    for num in numbers
        sum += num
        product *= num
    end
    
    return (sum, product)
end
```

This function iterates over the list of integers, calculates the sum and product of the elements, and returns them as a tuple. The function handles the case of an empty list by initializing `sum` to 0 and `product` to 1, which are the correct values for an empty sum and product, respectively.
