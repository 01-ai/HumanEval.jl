### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Extract the number of apples and oranges from the string**: The function needs to parse the input string to extract the number of apples and oranges. This can be done by splitting the string and extracting the relevant parts.

2. **Calculate the number of mangoes**: Once we have the number of apples and oranges, we can calculate the number of mangoes by subtracting the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits in the basket.

3. **Return the result**: The final step is to return the calculated number of mangoes.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Step 1: Extract the number of apples and oranges
    parts = split(s)  # Split the string into parts
    num_apples = parse(Int, parts[1])  # The number of apples is the first number in the string
    num_oranges = parse(Int, parts[4])  # The number of oranges is the fourth number in the string (after "and")
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the number of mangoes
    num_mangoes = n - (num_apples + num_oranges)
    
    # Step 3: Return the result
    return num_mangoes
end
```

This function first splits the input string into parts, extracts the numbers representing apples and oranges, calculates the number of mangoes by subtracting the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits, and finally returns the number of mangoes.
