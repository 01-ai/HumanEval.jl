# Outline

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This will hold the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of `xs`.
2. Iterate over the first k elements of `xs` using a for loop.
3. For each element, check if it has at most two digits. This can be done by converting the element to a string and checking its length.
4. If the element has at most two digits, add it to `sum`.
5. After the loop, return `sum`.

# Code

```julia
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:k
        if length(string(xs[i])) <= 2
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

# Test

```julia
julia> add_elements([111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4)
24
```
