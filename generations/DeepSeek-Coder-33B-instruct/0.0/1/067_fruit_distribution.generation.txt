Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)

    # Parse the number of apples and oranges
    apples = parse(Int, words[1])
    oranges = parse(Int, words[4])

    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges

    return mangoes
end
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into words. It then parses the first and fourth words as integers to get the number of apples and oranges. Finally, it subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.
