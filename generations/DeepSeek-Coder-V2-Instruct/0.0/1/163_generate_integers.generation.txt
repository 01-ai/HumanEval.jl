 Here's the implementation of the `generate_integers` function in Julia:

```julia
function generate_integers(a::Int, b::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Ensure a is less than or equal to b
    a, b = min(a, b), max(a, b)
    
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the even digits
    even_digits = Vector{Int}()
    
    # Iterate through the range from a to b
    for num in a:b
        # Check if the number is even
        if num % 2 == 0
            # Append the even number to the vector
            push!(even_digits, num)
        end
    end
    
    return even_digits
end
```

This function first ensures that `a` is less than or equal to `b` by swapping them if necessary. Then, it iterates through the range from `a` to `b`, checking each number to see if it is even. If a number is even, it is added to the `even_digits` vector. Finally, the function returns the vector of even digits.
