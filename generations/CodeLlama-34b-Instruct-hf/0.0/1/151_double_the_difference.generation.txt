  Here is a possible implementation of the `double_the_difference` function in Julia:
```
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    # Check if the input list is empty
    if isempty(xs)
        return 0
    end

    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0

    # Iterate over the list and calculate the sum of the squares of the odd numbers
    for x in xs
        if isodd(x) && x > 0
            sum += x^2
        end
    end

    # Return the sum
    return sum
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The function takes a single argument `xs`, which is a vector of numbers.
2. The first thing we do is check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return 0 immediately.
3. Next, we initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This will be used to store the sum of the squares of the odd numbers in the list.
4. We then iterate over the list using a `for` loop. For each element `x` in the list, we check if it is odd and if it is greater than 0. If both conditions are true, we add the square of `x` to the `sum`.
5. After the loop finishes, we return the `sum`.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
```
julia> double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0])
10

julia> double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0])
0

julia> double_the_difference([9, -2])
81

julia> double_the_difference([0])
0
```
