Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function simplify(x::String, n::String)::Bool
    # Split the fractions into numerators and denominators
    x_num, x_den = parse.(Int, split(x, "/"))
    n_num, n_den = parse.(Int, split(n, "/"))

    # Calculate the product of the fractions
    product = (x_num * n_num) / (x_den * n_den)

    # Check if the product is a whole number
    return isinteger(product)
end
```
This function first splits the string representations of the fractions into their numerators and denominators. It then calculates the product of the fractions. Finally, it checks if the product is a whole number by using the `isinteger` function. If the product is a whole number, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
