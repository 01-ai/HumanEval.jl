To implement the `triples_sum_to_zero` function in Julia, we can follow a straightforward approach. We will iterate through the list of integers using three nested loops, each picking a distinct element. For each combination of three distinct elements, we check if their sum equals zero. If we find such a combination, we return `true`. If we finish checking all possible combinations without finding any that sum to zero, we return `false`.

Here's how you can implement this function:

```julia
function triples_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    n = length(l)
    # If there are less than 3 elements, it's impossible to find a triple that sums to zero.
    if n < 3
        return false
    end

    # Iterate through the list with three nested loops to check every combination of three elements.
    for i in 1:n-2
        for j in i+1:n-1
            for k in j+1:n
                if l[i] + l[j] + l[k] == 0
                    return true
                end
            end
        end
    end

    # If no combination sums to zero, return false.
    return false
end
```

This function works as described but note that it has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the number of elements in the list. For large lists, this approach might not be efficient. However, it correctly implements the functionality as requested in the doc string.
