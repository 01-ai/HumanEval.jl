### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Sort the list**: The median is the middle value in a list of numbers, so we need to sort the list first to find the median.
2. **Check if the list length is odd or even**:
   - If the list length is odd, the median is the middle element.
   - If the list length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
3. **Calculate and return the median**:
   - For an odd-length list, return the middle element.
   - For an even-length list, calculate the average of the two middle elements and return it.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function median(l::Vector)
    # Step 1: Sort the list
    sorted_l = sort(l)
    
    # Step 2: Determine the length of the list
    n = length(sorted_l)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate and return the median
    if n % 2 == 1
        # If the list length is odd, return the middle element
        return sorted_l[div(n + 1, 2)]
    else
        # If the list length is even, return the average of the two middle elements
        mid1 = sorted_l[n รท 2]
        mid2 = sorted_l[n รท 2 + 1]
        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2
    end
end
```

This function first sorts the input vector, then checks if the length of the vector is odd or even, and finally calculates the median based on the length. For an even number of elements, it calculates the average of the two middle elements.
