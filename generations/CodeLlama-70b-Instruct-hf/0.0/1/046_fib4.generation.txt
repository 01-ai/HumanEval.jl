```julia
function fib4(n::Int)::Int
    # Check for invalid input
    if n < 0
        throw(DomainError(n, "Input must be a non-negative integer"))
    end

    # Initialize the first four elements of the sequence
    fib4_sequence = [0, 0, 2, 0]

    # Calculate the n-th element of the sequence using dynamic programming
    for i = 5:n
        fib4_sequence[i] = sum(fib4_sequence[i-4:i])
    end

    # Return the n-th element of the sequence
    return fib4_sequence[n]
end
```

This function uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the n-th element of the fib4 number sequence. It initializes the first four elements of the sequence and then calculates the remaining elements using the given formula. Finally, it returns the n-th element of the sequence.
