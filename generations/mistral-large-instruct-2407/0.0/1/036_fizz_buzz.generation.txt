 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `fizz_buzz` function in Julia based on the given doc string:

```julia
"""
    fizz_buzz(n::Int)

Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are
divisible by 11 or 13.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fizz_buzz(50)
0

julia> fizz_buzz(78)
2

julia> fizz_buzz(79)
3
```
"""
function fizz_buzz(n::Int)
    count = 0
    for i in 1:(n-1)
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0
            count += count(==('7'), string(i))
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `fizz_buzz` takes a single integer argument `n`.
2. **Initialization**: A counter `count` is initialized to zero. This will keep track of the number of times the digit '7' appears.
3. **Loop Through Numbers**: A loop iterates through all integers from 1 to `n-1`.
4. **Check Divisibility**: For each integer `i`, it checks if `i` is divisible by 11 or 13.
5. **Count Digit '7'**: If the integer is divisible by 11 or 13, it converts the integer to a string and counts the occurrences of the digit '7'.
6. **Update Counter**: The count of '7's is added to the `count`.
7. **Return Result**: Finally, the function returns the total count of '7's.

### Examples:
- `fizz_buzz(50)` returns `0` because there are no numbers less than 50 that are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit '7'.
- `fizz_buzz(78)` returns `2` because the numbers 77 and 78 are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit '7'.
- `fizz_buzz(79)` returns `3` because the numbers 77 and 78 are divisible by 11 or 13 and contain the digit '7', and 77 contains two '7's.
