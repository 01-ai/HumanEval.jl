# Outline

1. Initialize an empty vector `positive_xs` to store the positive numbers.
2. Iterate over each element `x` in the input vector `xs`.
3. Check if `x` is positive (greater than 0).
4. If `x` is positive, push it to the `positive_xs` vector.
5. After the loop, return the `positive_xs` vector.

# Code

```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector)
    # 1. Initialize an empty vector `positive_xs` to store the positive numbers.
    positive_xs = Int[]

    # 2. Iterate over each element `x` in the input vector `xs`.
    for x in xs
        # 3. Check if `x` is positive (greater than 0).
        if x > 0
            # 4. If `x` is positive, push it to the `positive_xs` vector.
            push!(positive_xs, x)
        end
    end

    # 5. After the loop, return the `positive_xs` vector.
    return positive_xs
end
