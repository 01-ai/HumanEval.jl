```julia
function search(numbers::Vector)
    # Create a dictionary to count the frequency of each number
    freq = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for num in numbers
        freq[num] = get(freq, num, 0) + 1
    end

    # Find the greatest number whose frequency is greater than or equal to the number itself
    result = -1
    for (num, count) in freq
        if count >= num && num > result
            result = num
        end
    end

    return result
end
```
This function first counts the frequency of each number in the given vector using a dictionary. Then it iterates over the dictionary to find the greatest number whose frequency is greater than or equal to the number itself. If no such number exists, it returns -1.
