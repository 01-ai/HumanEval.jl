 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `rounded_avg` function in Julia based on the provided docstring:

```julia
"""
    rounded_avg(n::Int, m::Int)::Union{Int, String}

You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). Round the answer
to the nearest integer and convert that to binary. If n is greater than m,
return -1.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rounded_avg(1, 5)
"11"

julia> rounded_avg(7, 5)
-1

julia> rounded_avg(10, 20)
"1111"

julia> rounded_avg(20, 33)
"11010"
```
"""
function rounded_avg(n::Int, m::Int)::Union{Int, String}
    if n > m
        return -1
    end

    # Calculate the sum of integers from n to m
    sum_nm = (m * (m + 1)) รท 2 - ((n - 1) * n) รท 2

    # Calculate the number of integers from n to m
    count_nm = m - n + 1

    # Calculate the average
    avg_nm = sum_nm รท count_nm

    # Convert the average to binary
    return string(avg_nm, base=2)
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if `n` is greater than `m`. If so, it returns `-1`.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of integers from `n` to `m` is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
3. **Count Calculation**: The number of integers from `n` to `m` is calculated.
4. **Average Calculation**: The average is computed by dividing the sum by the count.
5. **Binary Conversion**: The average is converted to a binary string using `string(avg_nm, base=2)`.

This function should work correctly for the given examples and any other valid inputs.
