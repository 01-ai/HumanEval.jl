To implement the `will_it_fly` function in Julia, we need to check two conditions:
1. The list `q` should be a palindrome.
2. The sum of the elements in `q` should be less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`.

Here's the implementation of the function:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the list is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = q == reverse(q)
    
    # Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to w
    sum_within_limit = sum(q) <= w
    
    # The object will fly if both conditions are met
    return is_palindrome && sum_within_limit
end
```

Let's break down the function:
- `is_palindrome = q == reverse(q)`: This checks if the list `q` is the same as its reverse, which means it is a palindrome.
- `sum_within_limit = sum(q) <= w`: This checks if the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to `w`.
- `return is_palindrome && sum_within_limit`: The function returns `true` only if both conditions are met.

Here are the examples provided in the docstring to test the function:

```julia
println(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # Expected output: false
println(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # Expected output: false
println(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # Expected output: true
println(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # Expected output: true
```

You can run these examples to verify that the function works correctly.
