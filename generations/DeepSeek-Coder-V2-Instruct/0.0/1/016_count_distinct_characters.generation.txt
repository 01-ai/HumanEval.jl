 Here's the implementation of the `count_distinct_characters` function in Julia:

```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case
    lower_s = lowercase(s)
    # Create a Set to store distinct characters
    distinct_chars = Set{Char}()
    # Iterate over each character in the string and add it to the Set
    for char in lower_s
        push!(distinct_chars, char)
    end
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return length(distinct_chars)
end
```

This function converts the input string to lowercase to ensure that the character count is case-insensitive. It then uses a `Set` to store each character, as sets automatically handle duplicates. Finally, it returns the size of the set, which corresponds to the number of distinct characters in the string.
