Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # Replace all spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")

    # Replace all consecutive underscores with -
    s = replace(s, r"_{2,}" => "-")

    return s
end
```

This function first replaces all spaces in the input string with underscores. Then it replaces all consecutive underscores (two or more) with a single hyphen.
