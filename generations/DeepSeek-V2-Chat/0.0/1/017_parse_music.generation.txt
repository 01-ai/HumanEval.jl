Here's the implementation of the `parse_music` function in Julia:

```julia
function parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}
    # Define the mapping from note symbols to their durations
    note_durations = Dict("o" => 4, "o|" => 2, ".|" => 1)
    
    # Split the input string into individual note symbols
    notes = split(music_string)
    
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the durations
    durations = Vector{Int}()
    
    # Iterate over each note symbol and convert it to its duration
    for note in notes
        if haskey(note_durations, note)
            push!(durations, note_durations[note])
        else
            error("Unknown note symbol: $note")
        end
    end
    
    return durations
end
```

This function first defines a dictionary mapping each note symbol to its corresponding duration. It then splits the input string into individual note symbols, iterates over each symbol, and converts it to its duration using the dictionary. The durations are collected into a vector and returned. If an unknown note symbol is encountered, an error is raised.
