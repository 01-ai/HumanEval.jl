```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    # Filter out non-integer and negative numbers, then filter out even numbers
    filtered_xs = filter(x -> x > 0 && x == floor(Int, x) && x % 2 != 0, xs)
    # Calculate the sum of squares of the filtered list
    return sum(x -> x^2, filtered_xs)
end
```
This function first filters the input vector to keep only positive, integer, and odd numbers. Then, it calculates the sum of squares of these numbers.
