  Here's one way to implement the `will_it_fly` function in Julia:
```
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the object is balanced (i.e., a palindromic list)
    if !is_palindrome(q)
        return false
    end

    # Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight
    if sum(q) > w
        return false
    end

    return true
end

# Helper function to check if a list is a palindrome
function is_palindrome(q::Vector{Int})::Bool
    return q == reverse(q)
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The `will_it_fly` function takes two arguments: `q`, a vector of integers, and `w`, an integer representing the maximum possible weight.
2. The function first checks if the object is balanced (i.e., a palindromic list) by calling the `is_palindrome` helper function. If the object is not balanced, the function returns `false`.
3. If the object is balanced, the function checks if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight. If the sum is greater than the maximum possible weight, the function returns `false`.
4. If the sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight, the function returns `true`.

The `is_palindrome` function is a simple helper function that checks if a list is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
