```julia
function even_odd_palindrome(n::Int)::Tuple{Int, Int}
    even_count, odd_count = 0, 0
    for num = 1:n
        str_num = string(num)
        if str_num == reverse(str_num)
            if iseven(num)
                even_count += 1
            else
                odd_count += 1
            end
        end
    end
    return (even_count, odd_count)
end
```
This Julia function iterates through each number from 1 to `n`, converts each number to a string to check if it's a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse, and then increments the appropriate count based on whether the palindrome is even or odd. It finally returns a tuple with the counts of even and odd integer palindromes.
