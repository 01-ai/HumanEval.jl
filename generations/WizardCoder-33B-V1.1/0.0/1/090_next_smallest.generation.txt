Here is the Julia function that implements the above doc string:

```julia
function next_smallest(xs::Vector{Int})::Union{Nothing,Int}
    unique_xs = unique(xs)
    length(unique_xs) < 2 && return nothing
    sort(unique_xs)[2]
end
```

This function works by first removing duplicates from the input list using the `unique` function. If the length of the list after removing duplicates is less than 2, it means there is no 2nd smallest element, so it returns `nothing`. Otherwise, it sorts the list and returns the 2nd element.
