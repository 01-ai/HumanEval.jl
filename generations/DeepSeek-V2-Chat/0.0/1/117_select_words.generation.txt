Here's the implementation of the `select_words` function in Julia:

```julia
function select_words(s::String, n::Int)::Vector{<:AbstractString}
    # Define a set of consonants
    consonants = Set('b':'d', 'f':'h', 'j':'n', 'p':'t', 'v':'z')
    
    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)
    
    # Filter words that contain exactly `n` consonants
    result = [word for word in words if count(c -> c in consonants, lowercase(word)) == n]
    
    return result
end
```

This function works as follows:
1. It defines a set of consonants for easy lookup.
2. It splits the input string `s` into individual words.
3. It filters these words to include only those that contain exactly `n` consonants by counting the consonants in each word.
4. It returns the filtered list of words.

You can test this function with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly.
