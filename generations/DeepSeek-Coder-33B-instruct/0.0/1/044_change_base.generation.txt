Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function change_base(x::Int, base::Int)::String
    if base < 2 || base > 10
        throw(DomainError(base, "base must be between 2 and 10"))
    end
    result = ""
    while x > 0
        result = string(x % base) * result
        x = div(x, base)
    end
    return result
end
```

This function works by repeatedly dividing the input number `x` by the base and appending the remainder to the result string. The remainder is the digit in the new base. The process is repeated until `x` is 0. The result string is then returned.

Please note that this function only works for bases between 2 and 10. If a base outside this range is given, a `DomainError` is thrown.
