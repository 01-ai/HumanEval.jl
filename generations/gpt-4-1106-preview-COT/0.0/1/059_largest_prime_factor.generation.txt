To implement the `largest_prime_factor` function in Julia, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable to store the largest prime factor found, initially set to 2 (the smallest prime number).
2. Divide `n` by 2 until it is no longer even. This step removes all factors of 2.
3. Starting from 3, test each odd number to see if it is a factor of `n`. If it is, divide `n` by this factor until it is no longer divisible by it. Update the largest prime factor variable each time a new factor is found.
4. Continue this process until the factor being tested exceeds the square root of `n`. At this point, if `n` is not 1, it means that `n` itself is a prime number and is the largest prime factor.
5. Return the largest prime factor found.

Now, let's write the code for the function:

```julia
function largest_prime_factor(n::Int)::Int
    # Step 1: Initialize the largest prime factor
    largest_factor = 2
    
    # Step 2: Remove all factors of 2
    while n % 2 == 0
        n รท= 2
    end
    
    # Step 3: Test odd factors
    factor = 3
    while factor * factor <= n
        while n % factor == 0
            largest_factor = factor
            n รท= factor
        end
        factor += 2
    end
    
    # Step 4: Check if the remaining n is a prime number
    if n > 2
        largest_factor = n
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return the largest prime factor
    return largest_factor
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(largest_prime_factor(13195)) # Should return 29
println(largest_prime_factor(2048))  # Should return 2
```

This function should work correctly for the given assumptions. However, it is not optimized for very large numbers, as it does not implement any advanced factorization algorithms like Pollard's rho algorithm or the elliptic curve method. For the scope of this task, the above implementation should suffice.
