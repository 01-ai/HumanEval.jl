To implement the `count_digits` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `product` to 1. This will hold the product of the odd digits.
2. Check if the input `n` is a positive integer. If not, return an error or handle the case accordingly.
3. Convert the integer `n` to a string to iterate over its digits.
4. Iterate over each character in the string representation of `n`.
5. For each character, convert it back to an integer to check if it's odd.
6. If the digit is odd, multiply it with the `product`.
7. After the loop, check if the `product` is still 1, which means there were no odd digits. If so, return 0.
8. Otherwise, return the `product`.

Now, let's write the code for the `count_digits` function:

```julia
function count_digits(n::Int)::Int
    # Step 1: Initialize the product of odd digits
    product = 1
    
    # Step 2: Check if n is positive
    if n <= 0
        throw(ArgumentError("Input must be a positive integer"))
    end
    
    # Step 3: Convert the integer to a string
    n_str = string(n)
    
    # Step 4: Iterate over each character in the string
    for digit_char in n_str
        # Step 5: Convert character to integer and check if it's odd
        digit = parse(Int, digit_char)
        if digit % 2 != 0
            # Step 6: Multiply the odd digit with the product
            product *= digit
        end
    end
    
    # Step 7: Check if the product is still 1 (no odd digits found)
    if product == 1
        return 0
    end
    
    # Step 8: Return the product of odd digits
    return product
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(count_digits(1))  # Should return 1
println(count_digits(4))  # Should return 0
println(count_digits(235)) # Should return 15
```

This function should now work as expected for the given task.
