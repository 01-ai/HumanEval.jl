```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    sentences = split(s, r"[.!?]")
    count = 0
    for sentence in sentences
        sentence = strip(sentence)
        if !isempty(sentence) && startswith(sentence, "I")
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```
This Julia function `is_bored` takes a string `s` as input and splits it into sentences using the punctuation marks `.`, `?`, and `!` as delimiters. It then iterates through each sentence, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, and checks if the sentence starts with the word "I". If it does, the `count` is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of sentences that start with "I", which represents the number of "boredoms".
