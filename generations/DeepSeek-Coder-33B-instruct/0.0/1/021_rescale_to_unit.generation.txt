Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function rescale_to_unit(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Vector{Float64}
    min_val = minimum(numbers)
    max_val = maximum(numbers)
    range_val = max_val - min_val
    return (numbers .- min_val) ./ range_val
end
```

This function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the input vector. It then calculates the range of the values and applies a linear transform to each element in the vector, such that the smallest value becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1. The transformed values are then returned as a new vector.
