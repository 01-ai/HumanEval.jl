Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String
    return join(xs)
end
```

This function uses the `join` function from Julia's standard library to concatenate all the strings in the input vector into a single string. The `join` function takes an array of strings and returns a single string where the input strings are concatenated in the order they appear in the array.

Here is how you can test this function:

```julia
println(concatenate(String[]))  # Output: ""
println(concatenate(["a", "b", "c"]))  # Output: "abc"
```
