 Here's the implementation of the `compare` function in Julia based on the provided doc string:

```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    return [game[i] == guess[i] ? 0 : abs(game[i] - guess[i]) for i in 1:length(game)]
end
```

This function iterates over each element in the `game` and `guess` vectors, compares them, and calculates the absolute difference if they are not equal. If they are equal, it assigns 0 to that position in the result vector.
