To implement the `find_zero` function, we need to find a root of the polynomial with the given coefficients. Since the problem statement specifies that `find_zero` only takes a list of coefficients with an even number of elements and the largest non-zero coefficient, this implies that the polynomial has at least one real root.

We can use numerical methods to find a root of the polynomial. One common method is the Newton-Raphson method, which is an iterative method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.

However, the Newton-Raphson method requires the derivative of the polynomial, which we would need to calculate. Alternatively, we can use a root-finding algorithm provided by Julia, such as `find_zero` from the `Roots` package.

First, let's implement the `poly` function as given:

```julia
"""
Evaluates polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x`. Return `xs[1] + xs[2] * x + xs[3] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n`.
"""
function poly(xs::Vector, x::Float64)
    return sum(coeff * (x^(i - 1)) for (i, coeff) in enumerate(xs))
end
```

Now, let's implement the `find_zero` function using the `Roots` package:

```julia
using Roots  # Make sure to add the Roots package using Pkg.add("Roots")

"""
    find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})

`xs` are coefficients of a polynomial. `find_zero` finds `x` such that `poly(x) = 0`. `find_zero` returns only one zero point, even if there are many. Moreover,
`find_zero` only takes list xs having an even number of coefficients and largest
non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
"""
function find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})
    # Check if the number of coefficients is even and the last coefficient is non-zero
    if length(xs) % 2 != 0 || xs[end] == 0
        error("The list of coefficients must have an even number of elements and the last coefficient must be non-zero.")
    end

    # Define the polynomial function
    f(x) = poly(xs, x)

    # Find a zero of the polynomial function
    zero = find_zero(f, 0.0)  # Starting at x=0.0
