### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Check for Special Cases**: First, handle special cases where `x` is 0 or 1, or `n` is 1. These cases have unique properties that can simplify the logic.
    - If `x` is 1, return `true` because any number to the power of 0 is 1.
    - If `n` is 1 and `x` is not 1, return `false` because 1 to any power is always 1, and no other number can be a power of 1.
    - If `x` is 0 and `n` is not 0, return `true` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `false`.

2. **Calculate the Logarithm**: Use the logarithm to find the power `int` that `n` must be raised to in order to get `x`. The formula to find this is `int = log(x) / log(n)`. This step helps to determine if `x` is a power of `n` without directly calculating large powers.

3. **Check if the Result is an Integer**: After calculating the potential power, check if it is an integer. If the result is an integer, it means `x` is a simple power of `n`.

4. **Return the Result**: Based on the check in the previous step, return `true` if the result is an integer, indicating that `x` is a simple power of `n`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function is_simple_power(x::Number, n::Number)::Bool
    # Handle special cases
    if x == 1
        return true
    elseif n == 1
        return x == 1
    elseif x == 0
        return n > 1
    end

    # Calculate the potential power using logarithm
    potential_power = log(x) / log(n)

    # Check if the potential power is an integer
    return potential_power == floor(potential_power)
end
```

This implementation covers the requirements specified in the doc string, including handling special cases and using logarithms to determine if `x` is a simple power of `n`.
