Here is the Julia function that meets the requirements:

```julia
function sorted_list_sum(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths
    filtered_list = filter(x -> length(x) % 2 == 0, xs)

    # Sort the list by length and then alphabetically
    sorted_list = sort(filtered_list, by=(x -> (length(x), x)))

    return sorted_list
end
```

This function first filters out the strings with odd lengths using the `filter` function. Then it sorts the list by length and alphabetically using the `sort` function with a custom `by` argument. The `by` argument is a tuple where the first element is the length of the string and the second element is the string itself. This ensures that the list is sorted first by length and then alphabetically.
