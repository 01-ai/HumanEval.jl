Here is the Julia function that fulfills the requirements:

```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector)
    return filter(x -> x > 0, xs)
end
```

This function uses the `filter` function to create a new vector that only includes the positive numbers from the input vector `xs`. The `filter` function takes a function and a collection, and returns a new collection that includes only the elements for which the function returns `true`. In this case, the function is `x -> x > 0`, which returns `true` for positive numbers and `false` for non-positive numbers.
