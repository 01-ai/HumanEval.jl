Here's the implementation of the `sorted_list_sum` function in Julia:

```julia
function sorted_list_sum(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths
    filtered_xs = filter(x -> length(x) % 2 == 0, xs)
    
    # Sort the filtered list by length, and then alphabetically if lengths are the same
    sorted_xs = sort(filtered_xs, by = x -> (length(x), x))
    
    return sorted_xs
end
```

This function first filters out the strings with odd lengths using the `filter` function. Then, it sorts the remaining strings by their length and alphabetically if the lengths are the same, using the `sort` function with a custom sorting key. The result is a list of strings sorted according to the specified rules.
