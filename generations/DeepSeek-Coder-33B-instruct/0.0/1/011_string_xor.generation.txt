Here is a Julia function that performs binary XOR on two strings:

```julia
function string_xor(a::String, b::String)::String
    if length(a) != length(b)
        throw(ArgumentError("Input strings must be of the same length"))
    end

    result = ""
    for i in 1:length(a)
        if a[i] == b[i]
            result *= "0"
        else
            result *= "1"
        end
    end

    return result
end
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input strings and comparing them. If the characters are the same, it appends a "0" to the result string. If they are different, it appends a "1". The result is a string of the same length as the input strings, where each character is the result of XORing the corresponding characters in the input strings.

Please note that this function assumes that the input strings are of the same length. If they are not, it throws an `ArgumentError`.
