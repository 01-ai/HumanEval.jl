Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function is_sorted(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool
    if length(xs) < 2
        return true
    end
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

This function works by iterating over the input vector `xs` and checking if each element is less than the previous one. If it finds an element that is not, it immediately returns `false`. If it gets through the entire vector without finding any such element, it returns `true`.

The function also handles the case where the input vector has only one element by returning `true`.
