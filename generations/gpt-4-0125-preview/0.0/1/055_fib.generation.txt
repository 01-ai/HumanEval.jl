Certainly! Below is the Julia implementation of the `fib` function to compute the n-th Fibonacci number.

```julia
function fib(n::Int)::Int
    if n <= 1
        return n
    else
        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
    end
end
```

This implementation uses a simple recursive approach. However, it's worth noting that this approach can be inefficient for large values of `n` due to the exponential growth in the number of function calls. For larger values, iterative approaches or memoization techniques are recommended to improve performance.
