Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function words_in_sentence(sentence::String)
    words = split(sentence)
    prime_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(length(word))]
    return join(prime_words, " ")
end

function is_prime(n::Int)
    if n == 1
        return false
    end
    for i in 2:sqrt(n)
        if n % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

This function first splits the sentence into words, then checks each word's length to see if it's a prime number. If it is, the word is added to the list of prime words. Finally, the function joins the prime words into a string with a space between each word.

The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by checking if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. If it does, the function returns false; otherwise, it returns true.
