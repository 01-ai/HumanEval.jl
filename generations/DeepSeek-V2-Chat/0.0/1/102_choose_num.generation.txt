Here's the implementation of the `choose_num` function in Julia:

```julia
function choose_num(x::Int, y::Int)::Int
    # Ensure x is the smaller number and y is the larger number
    x, y = min(x, y), max(x, y)
    
    # Find the largest even number in the range [x, y]
    for num in y:-1:x
        if num % 2 == 0
            return num
        end
    end
    
    # If no even number is found, return -1
    return -1
end
```

This function first ensures that `x` is the smaller number and `y` is the larger number. It then iterates from `y` down to `x` to find the largest even number in the range. If an even number is found, it returns that number; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
