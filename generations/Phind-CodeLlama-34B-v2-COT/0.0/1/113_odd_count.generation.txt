Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize an empty vector to store the result.
2. Iterate over the input vector of strings.
3. For each string, count the number of odd digits.
4. Replace all the "i"s in the docstring with the count of odd digits.
5. Append the modified string to the result vector.
6. Return the result vector.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function odd_count(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    result = String[]
    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        odd_count = count(isodd, parse.(Int, x))
        push!(result, replace("the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.", "i" => string(odd_count)))
    end
    return result
end
```

This function works by iterating over the input vector of strings and for each string, it counts the number of odd digits using the `count` function and `isodd`. It then replaces all occurrences of "i" in the docstring with the count of odd digits using the `replace` function. The modified string is then appended to the result vector. Finally, the result vector is returned.
