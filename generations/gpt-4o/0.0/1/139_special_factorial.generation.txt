To implement the `special_factorial` function in Julia, we need to compute the product of the factorials of all integers from 1 to `n`. Here's how you can do it:

1. Define the function `special_factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Use a loop or a comprehension to compute the factorial of each integer from 1 to `n`.
3. Multiply all these factorials together to get the final result.
4. Return the result as a `BigInt` to handle large numbers.

Here's the implementation:

```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    result = BigInt(1)
    for i in 1:n
        result *= factorial(BigInt(i))
    end
    return result
end
```

Let's break down the code:

- `result = BigInt(1)`: Initialize the result as a `BigInt` with the value 1.
- `for i in 1:n`: Loop through each integer from 1 to `n`.
- `result *= factorial(BigInt(i))`: Compute the factorial of `i` (converted to `BigInt` to handle large values) and multiply it with the current result.
- `return result`: Return the final result.

This function will correctly compute the special factorial for any positive integer `n`.

Here is an example usage of the function:

```julia
julia> special_factorial(4)
288
```

This matches the expected output as described in the docstring.
