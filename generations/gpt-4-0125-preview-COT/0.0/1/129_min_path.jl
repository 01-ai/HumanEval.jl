    min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}

Given a grid with `N` rows and `N` columns (`N >= 2`) and a positive integer
`k`, each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range `[1, N * N]` inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start from
any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells, in other
words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current cell.

Please note that a path of length `k` means visiting exactly `k` cells (not
necessarily distinct).

You CANNOT go off the grid.

A path `A` (of length k) is considered less than a path `B` (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that `A` and `B` go
through (let's call them `lst_A` and `lst_B`), `lst_A` is lexicographically less
than `lst_B`, in other words, there exist an integer index `i` (1 <= i <= k)
such that `lst_A[i] < lst_B[i]` and for any `j` (1 <= j < i) we have `lst_A[j] = lst_B[j]`. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique. Return an ordered list of
the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> min_path([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 1

julia> min_path([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1)
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
```

### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize Variables**: Create a priority queue to keep track of potential paths. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the current path (as a list of integers) and the current position (row, column) in the grid. Initialize the queue with all possible starting positions and their corresponding values in the grid.

2. **Define Helper Functions**:
   - **`get_neighbors`**: A function to get valid neighboring cells of the current cell. It should ensure that the neighbors are within the bounds of the grid.
   - **`is_valid`**: A function to check if a given cell (row, column) is within the bounds of the grid.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - While the priority queue is not empty, pop the element with the minimum path (lexicographically smallest) from the queue.
   - If the length of the current path is equal to `k`, return this path as it is the lexicographically smallest path of length `k`.
   - Otherwise, for the current cell, get all valid neighbors.
   - For each neighbor, create a new path by appending the neighbor's value to the current path and add this new path along with the neighbor's position to the priority queue.

4. **Return Result**: Once a path of length `k` is found that meets the criteria, return the path.
