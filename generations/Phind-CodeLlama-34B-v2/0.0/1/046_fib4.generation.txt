Here is a Julia function that implements the `fib4` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function fib4(n::Int)::Int
    if n < 0
        throw(DomainError(n, "Input must be a non-negative integer."))
    elseif n <= 1
        return 0
    elseif n == 2
        return 2
    elseif n == 3
        return 0
    end

    a, b, c, d = 0, 0, 2, 0
    for _ in 4:n
        a, b, c, d = b, c, d, a + b + c + d
    end

    return d
end
```

This function uses a loop and keeps track of the last four numbers in the sequence to compute the next number. This avoids the need for recursion and should be more efficient for large inputs.
