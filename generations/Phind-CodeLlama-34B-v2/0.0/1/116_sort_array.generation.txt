Here is the Julia implementation of the function based on the given docstring:

```julia
function sort_array(arr::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Calculate the number of ones in binary representation of each number
    # and use it as a key for sorting
    sort(arr, by = x -> (count_ones(x), x))
end
```

This function uses the `count_ones` function to count the number of ones in the binary representation of each number and the `sort` function to sort the array based on the count of ones and the decimal value of the numbers.

Here is how you can test the function:

```julia
julia> sort_array([1, 5, 2, 3, 4])
[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]

julia> sort_array([1, 0, 2, 3, 4])
[0, 1, 2, 4, 3]
```
