 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `will_it_fly` function in Julia based on the given doc string:

```julia
"""
    will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool

Write a function that returns `true` if the object `q` will fly, and `false`
otherwise. The object `q` will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list)
and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight
`w`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)  # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.
false

julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)  # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.
false

julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)  # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
true

julia> will_it_fly([3], 5)  # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
true
```
"""
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the list is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = q == reverse(q)

    # Calculate the sum of the elements in the list
    sum_of_elements = sum(q)

    # Return true if the list is a palindrome and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to w
    return is_palindrome && sum_of_elements <= w
end
```

This function first checks if the list `q` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. Then, it calculates the sum of the elements in the list. Finally, it returns `true` if the list is a palindrome and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`, otherwise it returns `false`.
