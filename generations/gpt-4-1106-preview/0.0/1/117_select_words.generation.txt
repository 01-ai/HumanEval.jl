Here's the Julia function `select_words` that matches the provided doc string:

```julia
function select_words(s::String, n::Int)::Vector{<:AbstractString}
    # Define a function to count consonants in a word
    function count_consonants(word::String)
        vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'])
        return count(c -> !in(c, vowels), word)
    end

    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)
    # Filter words that have exactly n consonants
    selected_words = filter(word -> count_consonants(word) == n, words)
    return selected_words
end

# Examples
println(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 4))
println(select_words("Mary had a little lamb", 3))
println(select_words("simple white space", 2))
println(select_words("Hello world", 4))
println(select_words("Uncle sam", 3))
```

This function first defines a helper function `count_consonants` to count the number of consonants in a given word. It then splits the input string `s` into words, filters the words based on the number of consonants they contain, and returns the filtered list of words.
