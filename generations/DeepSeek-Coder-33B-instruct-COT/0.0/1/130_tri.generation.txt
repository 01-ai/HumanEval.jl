Here is a Julia function that implements the Tribonacci sequence as described in the problem:

```julia
function tri(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    if n < 1
        return Int[]
    end

    seq = zeros(Int, n)
    seq[1] = 1

    for i in 2:n
        if i % 2 == 0
            seq[i] = i � 2
        else
            seq[i] = seq[i - 1] + seq[i - 2] + seq[i + 1]
        end
    end

    return seq
end
```

This function works by first checking if the input `n` is less than 1. If it is, it returns an empty array. Otherwise, it initializes an array `seq` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.

The first element of `seq` is set to 1. Then, for each subsequent element in `seq`, the function checks if the index `i` is even. If it is, the element is set to `i � 2`. If `i` is odd, the element is set to the sum of the previous three elements in `seq`.

Finally, the function returns `seq`.

Please note that Julia uses `�` for integer division and `/` for floating point division.
