```julia
function largest_smallest_integers(xs::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Union{Nothing, Int}, Union{Nothing, Int}}
    # Initialize results as nothing
    a = nothing
    b = nothing

    # Loop through the list
    for x in xs
        # If x is positive and b is nothing or x is smaller than b, update b
        if x > 0 && (b === nothing || x < b)
            b = x
        # If x is negative and a is nothing or x is larger than a, update a
        elseif x < 0 && (a === nothing || x > a)
            a = x
        end
    end

    # Return the tuple of a and b
    return (a, b)
end
```

This function loops through the list of integers and keeps track of the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. If there are no negative integers, `a` is set to `nothing`, and if there are no positive integers, `b` is set to `nothing`. The function then returns a tuple containing `a` and `b`.
