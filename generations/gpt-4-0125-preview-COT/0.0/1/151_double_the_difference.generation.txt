### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize a sum variable**: Start with a variable to keep track of the sum of squares of odd numbers, initialized to 0.

2. **Iterate through the list**: Go through each element in the input list.

3. **Check for conditions**: For each element, check if it is an integer, positive, and odd. This can be done by checking if the element is an instance of an integer, greater than 0, and if its remainder when divided by 2 is not 0.

4. **Square and add**: If an element meets the conditions, square it and add it to the sum variable.

5. **Return the sum**: After iterating through the entire list, return the sum variable.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    # Step 1: Initialize sum variable
    sum_of_squares = 0
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the list
    for x in xs
        # Step 3: Check for conditions (positive, integer, odd)
        if isa(x, Integer) && x > 0 && x % 2 != 0
            # Step 4: Square and add
            sum_of_squares += x^2
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return the sum
    return sum_of_squares
end
```
