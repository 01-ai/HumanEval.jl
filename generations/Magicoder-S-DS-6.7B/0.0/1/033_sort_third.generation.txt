Here is a Julia function that implements the `sort_third` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Create a copy of the input list
    l_prime = copy(l)

    # Get the indices of elements divisible by 3
    divisible_by_three = findall(i -> i % 3 == 0, 1:length(l))

    # Sort the elements at these indices
    sorted_values = sort(l[divisible_by_three])

    # Replace the elements at these indices with the sorted values
    l_prime[divisible_by_three] .= sorted_values

    return l_prime
end
```

This function works by first creating a copy of the input list `l`. It then identifies the indices of the elements in `l` that are divisible by 3. It sorts the elements at these indices and stores them in `sorted_values`. Finally, it replaces the elements at these indices in `l_prime` with the sorted values. The function then returns `l_prime`.
