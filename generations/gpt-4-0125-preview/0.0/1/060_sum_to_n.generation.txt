```julia
function sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int
    # Using the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers
    return n * (n + 1) รท 2
end
```

This Julia function `sum_to_n` calculates the sum of all natural numbers from `1` to `n` inclusively. It utilizes the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`, to efficiently compute the result. The `รท` operator is used for integer division, ensuring the result is an integer.
