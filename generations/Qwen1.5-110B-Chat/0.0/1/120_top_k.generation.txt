```julia
function top_k(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    if k == 0
        return Int[]  # Return an empty array if k is 0
    elseif k >= length(xs)
        return sort(xs, rev=true)  # Return the entire sorted array in descending order if k is equal or greater than the array length
    else
        return sort(xs, rev=true)[1:k]  # Return the top k numbers in descending order
    end
end
```
This Julia function `top_k` takes an array `xs` of integers and an integer `k`, and returns a new array containing the `k` largest elements from `xs` in descending order. It first checks if `k` is 0, in which case it returns an empty array. If `k` is as large as or larger than the length of `xs`, it sorts the entire array in descending order and returns it. Otherwise, it sorts the array in descending order and slices out the top `k` elements.
