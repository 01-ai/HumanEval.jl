To implement the `mean_absolute_deviation` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers.
2. Compute the absolute difference between each number and the mean.
3. Calculate the average of these absolute differences.
4. Return the result.

Now, let's write the code for the function:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Step 1: Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    x_mean = mean(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Compute the absolute differences
    abs_diffs = abs.(numbers .- x_mean)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the average of the absolute differences
    mad = mean(abs_diffs)
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return mad
end
```

To use this function, you can call it with a vector of `Float64` numbers:

```julia
mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
```

This should return `1.0` as shown in the example.
