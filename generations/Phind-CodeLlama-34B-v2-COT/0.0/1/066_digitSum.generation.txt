# Outline

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This will hold the sum of the ASCII values of uppercase characters.
2. Iterate over each character in the input string.
3. Check if the character is uppercase.
4. If it is, add its ASCII value to `sum`.
5. After the loop finishes, return `sum`.

# Code

```julia
function digitSum(s::String)::Int
    sum = 0
    for c in s
        if isuppercase(c)
            sum += Int(c)
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is uppercase (determined by the `isuppercase` function), its ASCII value is added to `sum`. After all characters have been checked, `sum` is returned.
