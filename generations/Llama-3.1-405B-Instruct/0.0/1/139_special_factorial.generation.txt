Here is the Julia function that implements the special factorial based on the provided docstring:
```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    result = BigInt(1)
    for i in 1:n
        result *= factorial(i)
    end
    return result
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We define the function `special_factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a `BigInt` value.
* We initialize the result variable to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of the factorials.
* We loop from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a `for` loop.
* Inside the loop, we multiply the result by the factorial of the current number `i` using the `factorial` function from the Julia standard library.
* After the loop, we return the final result.

Note that we use `BigInt` to represent the result, as the special factorial can grow very large quickly. Also, we use the `factorial` function from the Julia standard library to compute the factorial of each number, which is more efficient than implementing our own factorial function.

You can test the function using the example provided in the docstring:
```julia
julia> special_factorial(4)
288
```
