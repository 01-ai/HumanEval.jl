    # Initialize an empty list to store the coordinates
    coordinates = Tuple{Int, Int}[]

    # Iterate through the rows of the list
    for (i, row) in enumerate(xs)
        # Check if the integer x is present in the current row
        if x in row
            # Find the indices of x in the current row
            indices = findall(j -> j == x, row)

            # Append the coordinates to the list
            append!(coordinates, [(i, j) for j in reverse(indices)])
        end
    end

    # Sort the coordinates by rows in ascending order
    sort!(coordinates, by = x -> x[1])

    # Return the list of coordinates
    return coordinates
end
```

This function iterates through the rows of the list `xs` and checks if the integer `x` is present in the current row. If it is present, it finds the indices of `x` in the current row and appends the coordinates to the list of coordinates. Finally, it sorts the coordinates by rows in ascending order and returns the list of coordinates.
