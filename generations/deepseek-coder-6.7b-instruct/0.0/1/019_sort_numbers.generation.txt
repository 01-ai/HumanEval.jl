Here is the Julia function that sorts the numbers in a string from smallest to largest:

```julia
function sort_numbers(numbers::String)::String
    # Define a dictionary to map the string numbers to their corresponding integer values
    num_dict = Dict("zero" => 0, "one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3, "four" => 4, 
                    "five" => 5, "six" => 6, "seven" => 7, "eight" => 8, "nine" => 9)

    # Split the input string into a vector of words
    words = split(numbers)

    # Sort the words by their corresponding integer values
    sorted_words = sort(words, by=x->num_dict[x])

    # Join the sorted words back into a string
    sorted_numbers = join(sorted_words)

    return sorted_numbers
end
```

This function works by first defining a dictionary that maps the string numbers to their corresponding integer values. It then splits the input string into a vector of words, sorts the words by their corresponding integer values, and joins the sorted words back into a string. The sorted string is then returned.
