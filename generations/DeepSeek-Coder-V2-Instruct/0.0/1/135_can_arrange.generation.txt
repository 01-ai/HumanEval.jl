 Here's the implementation of the `can_arrange` function in Julia:

```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    for i in length(xs):-1:2
        if xs[i] < xs[i - 1]
            return i
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```

This function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking if each element is less than the element immediately preceding it. If such an element is found, the function returns its index. If no such element exists, the function returns -1.
