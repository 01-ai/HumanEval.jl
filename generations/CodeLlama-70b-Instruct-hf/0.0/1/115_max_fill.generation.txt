 Here is a possible implementation of the `max_fill` function in Julia:

```julia
function max_fill(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, capacity::Int)::Int
    # Initialize the number of times the buckets are lowered
    times_lowered = 0

    # Iterate over each row of the grid
    for row in grid
        # Initialize the number of units of water in the current row
        units_water = 0

        # Iterate over each column of the current row
        for col in row
            # If the current cell contains water, increment the number of units of water
            if col == 1
                units_water += 1
            end
        end

        # Calculate the number of times the buckets need to be lowered for the current row
        times_lowered += ceil(Int, units_water / capacity)
    end

    return times_lowered
end
```

This function iterates over each row of the grid, counts the number of units of water in each row, and calculates the number of times the buckets need to be lowered for that row based on the capacity. The total number of times the buckets are lowered is then returned.
