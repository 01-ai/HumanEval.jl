    valid_date(date::String)::Bool

You have to write a function which validates a given date string and returns
`true` if the date is valid otherwise `false` The date is valid if all of the
following rules are satisfied:

 1. The date string is not empty.
 2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months
    1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30
    days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or
    higher than 29 for the month 2.
 3. The months should not be less than 1 or higher than 12.
 4. The date should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> valid_date("03-11-2000")
true

julia> valid_date("15-01-2012")
false

julia> valid_date("04-0-2040")
false

julia> valid_date("06-04-2020")
true

julia> valid_date("06/04/2020")
false
```

### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Check if the date string is not empty**: Return `false` if the date string is empty.
2. **Check the format of the date string**: Use a regular expression to ensure the date is in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`. If it does not match, return `false`.
3. **Extract the month, day, and year from the date string**: Split the date string by `-` and convert the month, day, and year to integers.
4. **Validate the month**: Check if the month is between 1 and 12. If not, return `false`.
5. **Validate the day based on the month**:
    - For months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, check if the day is between 1 and 31.
    - For months 4, 6, 9, and 11, check if the day is between 1 and 30.
    - For month 2, check if the day is between 1 and 29.
    - If any of these conditions are not met, return `false`.
6. **Return `true`**: If all the above checks are passed, return `true`.
