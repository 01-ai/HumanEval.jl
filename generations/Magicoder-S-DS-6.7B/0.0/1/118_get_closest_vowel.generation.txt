Here is a Julia function that implements the above problem:

```julia
function get_closest_vowel(word::String)::String
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    for i in length(word):-1:2
        if word[i] in vowels && word[i-1] ∉ vowels && word[i+1] ∉ vowels
            return string(word[i])
        end
    end
    return ""
end
```

This function iterates over the word from right to left, skipping the first and last characters. If it finds a vowel that is not surrounded by consonants, it returns that vowel. If it doesn't find any such vowel, it returns an empty string.
