Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Check if the remaining carrots are enough to cover the need.
2. If there are enough, add the need to the number and subtract the need from the remaining.
3. If there are not enough, add the remaining to the number and set the remaining to 0.
4. Return the updated number and remaining as a vector.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function eat(number::Int, need::Int, remaining::Int)::Vector{Int}
    if remaining >= need
        number += need
        remaining -= need
    else
        number += remaining
        remaining = 0
    end
    return [number, remaining]
end
```

This function takes three integers as input and returns a vector of two integers. It first checks if the remaining carrots are enough to cover the need. If they are, it adds the need to the number and subtracts the need from the remaining. If there are not enough remaining carrots, it adds the remaining to the number and sets the remaining to 0. Finally, it returns the updated number and remaining as a vector.
