Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function fizz_buzz(n::Int)
    count = 0
    for i in 1:(n-1)
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0
            digits = string(i)
            for j in digits
                if j == '7'
                    count += 1
                end
            end
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates over all integers less than `n`, checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and if so, counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in the number. The final count is returned at the end of the function.
