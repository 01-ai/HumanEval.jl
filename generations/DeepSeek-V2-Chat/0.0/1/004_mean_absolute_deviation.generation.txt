Here's the implementation of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function in Julia:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    mean_value = mean(numbers)
    absolute_deviations = abs.(numbers .- mean_value)
    return mean(absolute_deviations)
end
```

This function calculates the mean absolute deviation as described in the docstring. It first computes the mean of the input vector, then calculates the absolute differences between each element and the mean, and finally returns the mean of these absolute differences.
