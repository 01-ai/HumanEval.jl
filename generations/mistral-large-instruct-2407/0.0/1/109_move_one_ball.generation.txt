 To solve the problem of determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing any number of right shift operations, we can use the following approach:

1. Check if the array is already sorted. If it is, return `true`.
2. Find the point in the array where the order is broken (i.e., where `xs[i] > xs[i+1]`).
3. Rotate the array at this point and check if the resulting array is sorted.
4. If the rotated array is sorted, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here is the implementation of the `move_one_ball` function in Julia:

```julia
"""
    move_one_ball(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool

We have an array `xs` of N integers xs[1], xs[2], ..., xs[N].The numbers in the
array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if it is possible to
get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the following
operation on the given array: You are allowed to perform right shift operation
any number of times.

One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
the starting position in the array.

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
then return `true` else return `false`. If the given array is empty then return
`true`.

Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])  # By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can be achieved for the given array.
true

julia> move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])  # It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given array by performing any number of right shift operations.
false
```
"""
function move_one_ball(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool
    isempty(xs) && return true

    # Check if the array is already sorted
    if issorted(xs)
        return true
    end

    n = length(xs)

    # Find the point where the order is broken
    for i in 1:n-1
        if xs[i] > xs[i+1]
            # Rotate the array at this point
            rotated_xs = vcat(xs[i+1:end], xs[1:i])
            # Check if the rotated array is sorted
            if issorted(rotated_xs)
                return true
            end
            break
        end
    end

    return false
end
```

This function first checks if the array is already sorted. If not, it finds the point where the order is broken and rotates the array at that point. It then checks if the rotated array is sorted. If it is, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`. If the array is empty, the function returns `true` as specified.
