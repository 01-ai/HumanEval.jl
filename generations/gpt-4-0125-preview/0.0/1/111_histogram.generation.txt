To implement the `histogram` function as described, we can follow these steps:

1. Split the input string by spaces to get individual letters.
2. Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each letter.
3. Find the maximum count of occurrences.
4. Filter the dictionary to keep only the letters with the maximum count.

Here's how you can implement it in Julia:

```julia
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    # Split the string into letters
    letters = split(s)
    # Initialize a dictionary to count occurrences
    letter_counts = Dict{String, Int}()
    
    # Count occurrences of each letter
    for letter in letters
        letter_counts[letter] = get(letter_counts, letter, 0) + 1
    end
    
    # Find the maximum count of occurrences
    max_count = maximum(values(letter_counts); init=0)
    
    # Filter the dictionary to keep only letters with the maximum count
    max_letters = Dict{String, Int}()
    for (letter, count) in letter_counts
        if count == max_count
            max_letters[letter] = count
        end
    end
    
    return max_letters
end
```

This function works as follows:
- It first splits the input string `s` into individual letters.
- Then, it counts how many times each letter appears in the string.
- It finds the maximum count of any letter(s).
- Finally, it filters the dictionary to return only those letters that have the maximum count, along with their counts.
