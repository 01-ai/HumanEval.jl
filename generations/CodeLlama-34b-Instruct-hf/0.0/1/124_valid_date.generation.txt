  Here is a possible implementation of the `valid_date` function in Julia:
```
function valid_date(date::String)::Bool
    # Check if the date string is empty
    if date == ""
        return false
    end

    # Split the date string into its components
    month, day, year = split(date, "-")

    # Check if the month is valid
    if !(1 <= month <= 12)
        return false
    end

    # Check if the day is valid
    if month in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12] && !(1 <= day <= 31)
        return false
    elseif month in [4, 6, 9, 11] && !(1 <= day <= 30)
        return false
    elseif month == 2 && !(1 <= day <= 29)
        return false
    end

    # Check if the year is valid
    if !(1 <= year <= 9999)
        return false
    end

    return true
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The function takes a single argument `date`, which is a string representing the date to be validated.
2. The first thing we do is check if the date string is empty. If it is, we return `false` immediately.
3. Next, we split the date string into its components using the `split` function. We assume that the date is in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`.
4. We check if the month is valid by checking if it is between 1 and 12. If it's not, we return `false`.
5. We then check if the day is valid by checking if it is between 1 and 31 for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and between 1 and 30 for months 4, 6, 9, and 11. If it's not, we return `false`.
6. We also check if the year is valid by checking if it is between 1 and 9999. If it's not, we return `false`.
7. If all of the above checks pass, we return `true`.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input date string is in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`. If the input date string is in a different format, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
