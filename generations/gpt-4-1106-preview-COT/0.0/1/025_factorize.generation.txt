To implement the `factorize` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty vector to store the prime factors.
2. Start with the smallest prime factor, which is 2.
3. Use a loop to divide the input number `n` by the current prime factor as long as it is divisible.
4. Each time `n` is divisible by the current prime factor, add that factor to the vector and divide `n` by the factor.
5. Once `n` is no longer divisible by the current prime factor, increment the factor to the next prime number.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the factor is greater than the square root of `n`. At this point, if `n` is not 1, it means `n` itself is a prime factor and should be added to the vector.
7. Return the vector of prime factors.

Now, let's write the code for the `factorize` function:
```julia
function factorize(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    factors = Int[]
    factor = 2
    while factor * factor <= n
        while n % factor == 0
            push!(factors, factor)
            n รท= factor
        end
        factor += (factor == 2 ? 1 : 2)  # Increment by 1 if factor is 2, otherwise by 2
    end
    if n > 1
        push!(factors, n)
    end
    return factors
end
```

This code will return the prime factors of the input number `n` in ascending order, with each factor repeated according to its multiplicity in the factorization of `n`.
