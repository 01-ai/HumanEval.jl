Sure, here is the Julia function that fulfills the requirements:

```julia
function flip_case(s::String)::String
    out = ""
    for c in s
        if islowercase(c)
            out *= uppercase(c)
        elseif isuppercase(c)
            out *= lowercase(c)
        else
            out *= c
        end
    end
    return out
end
```
This function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is lowercase, it converts it to uppercase and appends it to the output string. If the character is uppercase, it converts it to lowercase and appends it to the output string. If the character is neither lowercase nor uppercase (e.g., a number or a symbol), it appends the character to the output string as is. The function then returns the output string.
