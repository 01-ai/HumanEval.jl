Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize an empty vector `result` to store the final result.
2. Iterate over the input vector `numbers` using a for loop.
3. In each iteration, append the current number to `result`.
4. If the current number is not the last one in `numbers`, append `delimeter` to `result` as well.
5. Return `result` at the end.

And here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function intersperse(numbers::Vector{Int}, delimeter::Int)::Vector{Int}
    result = Int[]
    for (i, num) in enumerate(numbers)
        push!(result, num)
        if i != length(numbers)
            push!(result, delimeter)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function works by iterating over the input vector `numbers` and appending each number to the result vector `result`. If the current number is not the last one in `numbers`, it also appends `delimeter` to `result`. Finally, it returns `result`.
