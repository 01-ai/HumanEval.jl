Here's the implementation of the `rescale_to_unit` function in Julia:

```julia
function rescale_to_unit(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Vector{Float64}
    min_val = minimum(numbers)
    max_val = maximum(numbers)
    range = max_val - min_val
    return (numbers .- min_val) ./ range
end
```

This function works as follows:
1. It calculates the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) of the input vector `numbers`.
2. It computes the range (`range`) as the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
3. It applies the linear transformation to each element in the vector: subtracting the minimum value and then dividing by the range.
4. The result is a vector where the smallest number is transformed to 0 and the largest number is transformed to 1.

You can test the function with the provided example:

```julia
julia> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
5-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.0
 0.25
 0.5
 0.75
 1.0
```
