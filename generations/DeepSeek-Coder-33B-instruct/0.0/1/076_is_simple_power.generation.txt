Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function is_simple_power(x::Number, n::Number)::Bool
    if n == 1
        return x == 1
    elseif x == 1
        return true
    else
        return n^round(Int, log(n, x)) == x
    end
end
```

This function works by taking the logarithm of `x` to the base `n`, rounding it to the nearest integer, and then raising `n` to that power. If the result is equal to `x`, then `x` is a simple power of `n`. If `n` is 1, then `x` must also be 1 for `x` to be a simple power of `n`. If `x` is 1, then `x` is a simple power of any `n`.
