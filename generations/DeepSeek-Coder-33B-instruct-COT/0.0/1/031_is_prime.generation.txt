Here is a step-by-step outline of how you can implement the `is_prime` function in Julia:

1. Check if the number is less than 2. If it is, return `false` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
2. Check if the number is 2. If it is, return `true` because 2 is a prime number.
3. Check if the number is even. If it is, return `false` because even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.
4. Check if the number can be divided evenly by any odd number up to its square root. If it can, return `false` because the number is not prime.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, return `true` because the number is prime.

Here is the Julia code that implements the above outline:

```julia
function is_prime(n::Int)
    if n < 2
        return false
    elseif n == 2
        return true
    elseif n % 2 == 0
        return false
    end
    for i in 3:2:isqrt(n)
        if n % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

This function uses the `isqrt` function to get the integer square root of `n`, which is used to limit the range of numbers that are checked for divisibility. The `2:2:isqrt(n)` expression generates a range of odd numbers from 3 up to the square root of `n`.
