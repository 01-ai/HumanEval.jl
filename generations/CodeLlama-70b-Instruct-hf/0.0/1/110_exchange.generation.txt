```julia
function exchange(lst1::Vector{Int}, lst2::Vector{Int})::String
    # Count the number of odd numbers in lst1
    odd_count = count(x -> x % 2 == 1, lst1)

    # If there are an odd number of odd numbers, it's not possible to make all the elements of lst1 even
    if odd_count % 2 == 1
        return "NO"
    end

    # If there are an even number of odd numbers, it's possible to make all the elements of lst1 even
    return "YES"
end
```

This function first counts the number of odd numbers in `lst1`. If there are an odd number of odd numbers, it's not possible to make all the elements of `lst1` even. If there are an even number of odd numbers, it's possible to make all the elements of `lst1` even.
