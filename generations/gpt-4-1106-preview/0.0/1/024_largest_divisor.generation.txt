Certainly! Below is the Julia function `largest_divisor` that implements the functionality described in the doc string:

```julia
function largest_divisor(n::Int)::Int
    # Start from n-1 and go down to find the largest divisor
    for i in reverse(2:n-1)
        if n % i == 0
            return i
        end
    end
    # If no divisor is found other than 1, return 1
    return 1
end

# Example usage:
# println(largest_divisor(15)) # Should print 5
```

This function iterates from `n-1` down to `2` and checks if the current number divides `n` evenly. If it finds such a number, it returns it as the largest divisor. If no divisor other than 1 is found, it returns 1.
