Here is the Julia function that implements the given problem:

```julia
function sorted_list_sum(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Filter out strings with even length
    xs = filter(x -> length(x) % 2 == 0, xs)

    # Sort the list by length and then alphabetically
    sort(xs, by = x -> (length(x), x))
end
```

This function first filters out the strings with odd lengths using the `filter` function. Then it sorts the list by length and then alphabetically using the `sort` function with a tuple as the `by` argument. The `length` function is used to get the length of each string and the `x` function is used to get the string itself for sorting.
