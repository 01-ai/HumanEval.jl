### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize** two variables, `sum` and `product`, with values `0` and `1` respectively. These will hold the cumulative sum and product of the integers in the list.

2. **Iterate** through each integer in the given list of integers.
   - For each integer, **add** it to `sum`.
   - For each integer, **multiply** it with `product`.

3. **Return** a tuple containing the final `sum` and `product` after iterating through the entire list.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    # Step 1: Initialize sum and product
    sum = 0
    product = 1
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the list of integers
    for number in numbers
        sum += number       # Add current number to sum
        product *= number   # Multiply current number with product
    end
    
    # Step 3: Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return (sum, product)
end
```

This function should work as expected for both empty and non-empty lists of integers, returning a tuple of the sum and product according to the specifications.
