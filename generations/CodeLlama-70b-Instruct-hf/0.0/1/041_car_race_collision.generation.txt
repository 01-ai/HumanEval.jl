```julia
function car_race_collision(n::Int)::Int
    return n * (n - 1) รท 2
end
```

This function calculates the number of collisions that will occur in a car race with `n` cars. The number of collisions is calculated using the formula `n * (n - 1) รท 2`, which is the sum of the first `n - 1` natural numbers. This is because each car on the left will collide with every car on the right, and vice versa.
