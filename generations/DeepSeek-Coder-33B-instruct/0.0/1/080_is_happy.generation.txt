Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function is_happy(s::String)::Bool
    if length(s) < 3
        return false
    end
    for i in 1:(length(s)-2)
        if s[i] == s[i+1] || s[i] == s[i+2] || s[i+1] == s[i+2]
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

This function first checks if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, it returns false because a string with less than 3 characters cannot be happy. Then it checks every 3 consecutive letters in the string. If any of them are the same, it returns false because the string is not happy. If it goes through all the letters without finding any 3 consecutive letters that are the same, it returns true because the string is happy.
