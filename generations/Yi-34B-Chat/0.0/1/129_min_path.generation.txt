```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Initialize the result with the first k elements of the grid
    result = grid[1][1:k]
    
    # Loop through the grid to find the minimum path
    for i in 1:length(grid)
        for j in 1:length(grid[i])
            # If the current cell is not part of the result yet
            if j <= k && result[end] != grid[i][j]
                # Check if the current cell is part of a shorter path
                if k == 1 || result[end-1] != grid[i][j-1]
                    # If so, update the result
                    result[end] = grid[i][j]
                    k -= 1
                    
                    # If the path is complete, return the result
                    if k == 0
                        return result
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
    
    # If the path is not found, return an empty vector
    return result
end
```

This function works by iterating through the grid and updating the result vector with the next element of the minimum path. It uses a simple greedy approach to find the minimum path by always choosing the smallest available value that is not part of the current path.
