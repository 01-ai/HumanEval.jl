Here is a Julia function that implements the factorize function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function factorize(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    factors = Int[]
    for i in 2:n
        while n % i == 0
            push!(factors, i)
            n = div(n, i)
        end
    end
    return factors
end
```

This function works by iterating over all integers from 2 to n (inclusive) and checking if n is divisible by the current integer. If it is, the current integer is a factor of n, and it is added to the list of factors. The value of n is then divided by the current integer to reduce the problem size for the next iteration. This process continues until n is no longer divisible by the current integer, at which point the next integer is checked. The loop terminates when n becomes 1, at which point all of its factors have been found.
