Here is the Julia function based on the given doc string:

```julia
function eat(number::Int, need::Int, remaining::Int)::Vector{Int}
    if need <= remaining
        return [number + need, remaining - need]
    else
        return [number + remaining, 0]
    end
end
```

This function first checks if the number of carrots needed is less than or equal to the remaining carrots. If it is, it returns a vector with the total number of eaten carrots after meals and the remaining carrots after meals. If the number of carrots needed is more than the remaining carrots, it returns a vector with the total number of eaten carrots after meals and 0 remaining carrots.
