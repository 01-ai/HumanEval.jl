Here is a Julia function that implements the functionality described in the doc string:

```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)
    if length(l) < 2
        return true
    end

    increasing = false
    decreasing = false

    for i in 1:(length(l)-1)
        if l[i+1] > l[i]
            increasing = true
        elseif l[i+1] < l[i]
            decreasing = true
        end

        if increasing && decreasing
            return false
        end
    end

    return true
end
```

However, this function can be simplified by using the `all` function in Julia:

```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)
    return all(x -> x >= 0, diff(l)) || all(x -> x <= 0, diff(l))
end
```

This function works by taking the difference between each pair of elements in the vector (using the `diff` function), and then checking if all of these differences are non-negative (indicating a monotonically increasing sequence) or non-positive (indicating a monotonically decreasing sequence).
