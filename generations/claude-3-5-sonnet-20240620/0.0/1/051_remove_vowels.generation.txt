Here's a Julia function that implements the `remove_vowels` functionality as described:

```julia
function remove_vowels(text::String)::String
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    return join(filter(c -> !(c in vowels), text))
end
```

This function does the following:

1. We define a string `vowels` containing all vowels (both lowercase and uppercase).

2. We use the `filter` function to create a new string containing only the characters that are not vowels.

3. The `!(c in vowels)` condition checks if each character `c` is not in the `vowels` string.

4. Finally, we use `join` to concatenate the filtered characters back into a single string.

This implementation will remove all vowels (both lowercase and uppercase) from the input string and return the result. It handles all the cases mentioned in the examples, including:

- Returning an empty string when all characters are removed
- Preserving non-vowel characters, including spaces and special characters
- Handling both lowercase and uppercase vowels
- Returning the original string if it contains no vowels

You can use this function as follows:

```julia
julia> remove_vowels("\\")
"\\"

julia> remove_vowels("abcdef\\nghijklm")
"bcdf\\nghjklm"

julia> remove_vowels("abcdef")
"bcdf"

julia> remove_vowels("aaaaa")
""

julia> remove_vowels("aaBAA")
"B"

julia> remove_vowels("zbcd")
"zbcd"
```

This implementation should work correctly for all the provided examples and any other input strings.
