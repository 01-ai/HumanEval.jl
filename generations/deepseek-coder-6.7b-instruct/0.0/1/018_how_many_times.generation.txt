Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function how_many_times(s::String, sub_s::String)::Int
    count = 0
    len_sub = length(sub_s)
    for i in 1:length(s)
        if s[i:i+len_sub-1] == sub_s
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function works by iterating over the string `s` and checking if the substring `sub_s` is equal to the substring of `s` that starts at position `i` and is of the same length as `sub_s`. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.

Please note that this function does not handle cases where `sub_s` is longer than `s`. If you want to handle such cases, you can add a check at the beginning of the function to return 0 if `sub_s` is longer than `s`.
