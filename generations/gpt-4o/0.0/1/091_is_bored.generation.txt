Sure, let's implement the `is_bored` function in Julia. The function will count the number of sentences that start with the word "I". Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.

Here's the implementation:

```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences using '.', '?', and '!' as delimiters
    sentences = split(s, r"[.?!]")
    
    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Trim leading and trailing whitespace from the sentence
        trimmed_sentence = strip(sentence)
        
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if startswith(trimmed_sentence, "I")
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end
    
    return boredom_count
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **Splitting the String**: We use the `split` function with a regular expression `r"[.?!]"` to split the input string into sentences based on the delimiters '.', '?', and '!'.
2. **Trimming Whitespace**: For each sentence, we use the `strip` function to remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
3. **Checking for Boredom**: We use the `startswith` function to check if the trimmed sentence starts with the word "I". If it does, we increment the `boredom_count`.
4. **Returning the Count**: Finally, we return the count of boredoms.

### Examples:
```julia
println(is_bored("Hello world"))  # Output: 0
println(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))  # Output: 1
```

This function should work as expected for the given examples and similar inputs.
