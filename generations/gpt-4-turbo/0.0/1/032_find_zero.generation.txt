    find_zero(xs::Vector{Int}) -> Float64

`xs` are coefficients of a polynomial. `find_zero` finds `x` such that `poly(xs, x) = 0`. `find_zero` returns only one zero point, even if there are many. Moreover,
`find_zero` only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest
non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> round(find_zero([1, 2]), digits = 1) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
-0.5

julia> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), digits = 1) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
1.0
```

    if length(xs) % 2 != 0 || xs[end] == 0
        error("The polynomial must have an even number of coefficients and the highest degree coefficient must be non-zero.")
    end

    # Define the polynomial function
    polynomial = x -> poly(xs, x)

    # Find a zero using the Roots package
    zero = find_zero(polynomial)
