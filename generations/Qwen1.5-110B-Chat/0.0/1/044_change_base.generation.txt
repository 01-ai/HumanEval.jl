```julia
function change_base(x::Int, base::Int)::String
    if base < 2 || base > 9
        error("Base must be between 2 and 9")
    end
    digits = "0123456789"
    result = ""
    while x > 0
        digit = x % base + 1
        result = digits[digit] * result
        x = x รท base
    end
    return result
end
```
This function `change_base` takes an integer `x` and a base `base` as inputs and converts the number `x` into its string representation in the specified base. It first checks if the base is within the valid range (2 to 9), then iteratively divides `x` by the base and keeps track of the remainders, which represent the digits in the new base. The remainders are appended to the result string in reverse order, and the final result is returned as a string.
