    return true
end
```

This function iterates through the string and pushes opening brackets onto a stack. When it encounters a closing bracket, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means that there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so it returns false. If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element from the stack.

After iterating through the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means that all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns false. If the stack is not empty, it means that there is at least one opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket, so it returns true.
