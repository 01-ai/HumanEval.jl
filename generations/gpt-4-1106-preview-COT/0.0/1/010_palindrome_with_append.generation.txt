To implement the `palindrome_with_append` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `palindrome_with_append(s::String)::String`.
2. Check if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, return an empty string as the shortest palindrome.
3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the longest palindromic suffix. Let's call it `palindrome_suffix`.
4. Iterate over the string `s` from the end to the beginning to find the longest palindromic suffix.
   - In each iteration, check if the current suffix is a palindrome.
   - If it is, update `palindrome_suffix` with the current suffix.
5. Once the longest palindromic suffix is found, determine the prefix that comes before it.
6. Reverse the prefix and append it to the end of the original string `s`.
7. Return the resulting string as the shortest palindrome that begins with `s`.

Now, let's write the code for the function based on the above outline.
