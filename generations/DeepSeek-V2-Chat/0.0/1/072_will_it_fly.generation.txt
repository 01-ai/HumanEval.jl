Here's the implementation of the `will_it_fly` function in Julia:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the list is palindromic
    is_palindromic = q == reverse(q)
    
    # Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight
    is_within_weight = sum(q) <= w
    
    # Return true if both conditions are met
    return is_palindromic && is_within_weight
end
```

This function first checks if the list `q` is palindromic by comparing it to its reverse. Then, it checks if the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. If both conditions are met, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
