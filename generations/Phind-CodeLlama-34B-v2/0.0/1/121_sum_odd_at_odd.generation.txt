Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function sum_odd_at_odd(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:2:length(xs)
        if xs[i] % 2 != 0
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates over the elements in the input vector `xs` with a step of 2 (i.e., it only considers elements at odd positions), checks if the element at the current position is odd, and if it is, adds it to the sum. The function returns the total sum of all odd elements at odd positions.
