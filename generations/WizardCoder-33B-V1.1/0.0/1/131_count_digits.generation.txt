Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function count_digits(n::Int)::Int
    digits = reverse(digit.(n))
    product = 1
    for digit in digits
        if digit % 2 != 0
            product *= digit
        end
    end
    return product == 1 ? 0 : product
end
```

This function works by first converting the integer into an array of its digits, then iterating over the digits. If a digit is odd, it multiplies the current product by the digit. If the product remains 1 after all digits have been checked, it means all digits were even, so it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the product.
