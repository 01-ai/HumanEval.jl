Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function anti_shuffle(s::String)::String
    words = split(s, " ")
    ordered_words = map(words) do word
        chars = collect(word)
        sort!(chars)
        join(chars)
    end
    ordered_sentence = join(ordered_words, " ")
    return ordered_sentence
end
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into words, then sorting the characters in each word, and finally joining the sorted words back together into a sentence. The sorting is done in-place (using `sort!`) based on the ASCII values of the characters. The `join` function is used to combine the characters of a word back into a string, and to combine the words of the sentence back into a string with spaces in between.
