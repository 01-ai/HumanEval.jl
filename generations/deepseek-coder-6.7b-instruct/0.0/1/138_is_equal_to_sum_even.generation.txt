Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int)::Bool
    for i in 2:n-1
        if i % 2 == 0 && (n - i) % 2 == 0
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This function works by iterating over all even numbers less than `n` and checking if `n - i` is also an even number. If it is, the function returns `true`, indicating that `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If no such pair of numbers is found, the function returns `false`.

Please note that this function has a time complexity of O(n) and may not be efficient for large inputs.
