Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This will hold the sum of squares of the odd numbers in the list.
2. Iterate over each number `x` in the input list `xs`.
3. Check if `x` is an integer and not negative.
4. If `x` is odd, add the square of `x` to `sum`.
5. After the loop finishes, return `sum`.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    sum = 0
    for x in xs
        if isinteger(x) && x > 0 && x % 2 != 0
            sum += x^2
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function works by iterating over each number in the input list, checking if it's an integer and not negative, and if it's odd, adding its square to the running total. The function then returns the total sum.
