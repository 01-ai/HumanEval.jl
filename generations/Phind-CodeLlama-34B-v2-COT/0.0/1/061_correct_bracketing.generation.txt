# Outline

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the brackets.
2. Iterate through the string.
3. If the current character is an opening bracket, push it to the stack.
4. If the current character is a closing bracket, check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is a corresponding opening bracket. If it is, pop the stack. If it's not, return false.
5. After iterating through the string, check if the stack is empty. If it is, return true. If it's not, return false.

# Code

```julia
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets
        if bracket == '('
            push!(stack, bracket)
        elseif bracket == ')'
            if isempty(stack) || stack[end] != '('
                return false
            else
                pop!(stack)
            end
        end
    end
    return isempty(stack)
end
