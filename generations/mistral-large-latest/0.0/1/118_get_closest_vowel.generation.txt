Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function get_closest_vowel(word::String)::String
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ"

    for i in length(word)-1:-1:2
        if word[i] in vowels && word[i-1] in consonants && word[i+1] in consonants
            return word[i]
        end
    end

    return ""
end
```

This function iterates over the word from the right side (index `length(word)-1` to `2`) and checks if the current character is a vowel and both its neighbors are consonants. If it finds such a vowel, it returns it. If it doesn't find any vowel that meets the conditions, it returns an empty string.
