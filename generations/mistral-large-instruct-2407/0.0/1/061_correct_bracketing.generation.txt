 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `correct_bracketing` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool

Brackets is a string of "(" and ")". Return `true` if every opening bracket has
a corresponding closing bracket.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> correct_bracketing("(")
false

julia> correct_bracketing("()")
true

julia> correct_bracketing("(()())")
true

julia> correct_bracketing(")(()")
false
```
"""
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    stack = []
    for char in brackets
        if char == '('
            push!(stack, char)
        elseif char == ')'
            if isempty(stack)
                return false
            else
                pop!(stack)
            end
        end
    end
    return isempty(stack)
end
```

This function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. It iterates through each character in the input string `brackets`. If it encounters an opening bracket `(`, it pushes it onto the stack. If it encounters a closing bracket `)`, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the closing bracket, so it returns `false`. If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element from the stack. Finally, after processing all characters, it checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, so it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
