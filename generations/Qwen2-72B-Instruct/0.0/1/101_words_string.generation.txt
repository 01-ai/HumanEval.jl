```julia
function words_string(s::String)
    # Split the string by either comma or space and filter out any empty strings
    return filter(x -> !isempty(x), split(s, r"[,\s]+"))
end
```
This function uses a regular expression to split the string by either a comma or a space, and then filters out any empty strings that may result from consecutive delimiters.
