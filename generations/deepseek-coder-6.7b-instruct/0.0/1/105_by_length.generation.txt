Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function by_length(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{String}
    if isempty(xs)
        return String[]
    end

    names = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"]
    filtered = filter(x -> x >= 1 && x <= 9, xs)
    sorted = sort(filtered, rev=true)

    return [names[i] for i in sorted]
end
```

This function first checks if the input vector is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string vector.

Then it filters the input vector to keep only the integers between 1 and 9 inclusive.

It sorts the filtered vector in descending order.

Finally, it uses a comprehension to replace each integer in the sorted vector by its corresponding name from the `names` array.

The result is a vector of strings.
