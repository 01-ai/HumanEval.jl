Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function vowels_count(s::String)::Int
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0
    for char in s
        if char == 'y' || char == 'Y'
            if char == last(s)
                count += 1
            end
        elseif char in vowels
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is 'y' or 'Y', it checks if it's the last character of the string and increments the count if it is. If the character is any other vowel, it simply increments the count. The function finally returns the total count of vowels.
