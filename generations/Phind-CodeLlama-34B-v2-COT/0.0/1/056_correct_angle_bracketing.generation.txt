# Outline

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the brackets.
2. Iterate through the string.
3. If the current character is an opening bracket ("<"), push it to the stack.
4. If the current character is a closing bracket (">"), check if the stack is empty.
5. If the stack is not empty, pop the last bracket from the stack.
6. If the stack is empty after checking for a closing bracket, return false.
7. After iterating through the entire string, check if the stack is empty.
8. If the stack is not empty, return false. Otherwise, return true.

# Code

```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of the brackets
    stack = []

    # Iterate through the string
    for bracket in brackets
        # If the current character is an opening bracket ("<"), push it to the stack
        if bracket == '<'
            push!(stack, bracket)
        # If the current character is a closing bracket (">"), check if the stack is empty
        elseif bracket == '>'
            # If the stack is not empty, pop the last bracket from the stack
            if !isempty(stack)
                pop!(stack)
            # If the stack is empty after checking for a closing bracket, return false
            else
                return false
            end
        end
    end

    # After iterating through the entire string, check if the stack is empty
    # If the stack is not empty, return false. Otherwise, return true
    return isempty(stack)
