To implement the `intersperse` function in Julia, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the input vector `numbers` is empty. If it is, return an empty vector immediately.
2. Initialize an empty vector `result` that will store the final sequence of numbers with the delimiter interspersed.
3. Iterate through the `numbers` vector, adding each element to the `result` vector followed by the `delimeter`, except for the last element.
4. After the loop, add the last element of `numbers` to `result` without following it with a `delimeter`.
5. Return the `result` vector.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above logic:

```julia
function intersperse(numbers::Vector{Int}, delimeter::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Check if the input vector is empty
    if isempty(numbers)
        return Int[]
    end
    
    # Initialize the result vector
    result = Int[]
    
    # Iterate through the numbers, adding each number and the delimeter to the result
    for i in 1:length(numbers)-1
        push!(result, numbers[i])
        push!(result, delimeter)
    end
    
    # Add the last number without a following delimeter
    push!(result, numbers[end])
    
    return result
end
```

This function works by iterating through the input vector and inserting the specified delimiter between each pair of elements, except after the last element. It handles the case of an empty input vector by returning an empty vector immediately.
