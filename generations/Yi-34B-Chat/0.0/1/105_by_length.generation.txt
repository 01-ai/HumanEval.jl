```julia
function by_length(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{String}
    # Sort the array and filter out numbers that are not between 1 and 9 inclusive
    sorted_xs = sort(xs)
    filtered_xs = sorted_xs[sorted_xs .>= 1]
    filtered_xs = filtered_xs[filtered_xs .<= 9]

    # Reverse the filtered array
    reversed_xs = reverse(filtered_xs)

    # Replace each digit with its corresponding name
    names = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"]
    names_xs = [names[x] for x in reversed_xs]

    return names_xs
end
```

This function sorts the array of integers, filters out numbers that are not between 1 and 9 inclusive, reverses the filtered array, and then replaces each digit with its corresponding name from a pre-defined string array. If the input array is empty, an empty array of strings is returned.
