Here is a Julia function that implements the `correct_angle_bracketing` function based on the provided docstring:
```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets
        if bracket == '<'
            push!(stack, bracket)
        elseif bracket == '>'
            if isempty(stack)
                return false
            else
                pop!(stack)
            end
        end
    end
    return isempty(stack)
end
```
Here's an explanation of the implementation:

* We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket `<`, we push it onto the stack.
* When we encounter a closing bracket `>`, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no corresponding opening bracket, so we return `false`. Otherwise, we pop the opening bracket from the stack.
* After iterating through all the brackets, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so we return `true`. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we return `false`.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring:
```julia
println(correct_angle_bracketing("<"))  # false
println(correct_angle_bracketing("<>"))  # true
println(correct_angle_bracketing("<<><>>"))  # true
println(correct_angle_bracketing("><<>"))  # false
```
