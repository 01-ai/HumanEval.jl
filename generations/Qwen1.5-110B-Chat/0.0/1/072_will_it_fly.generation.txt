```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the list is a palindrome (balanced)
    is_balanced = q == reverse(q)
    
    # Check if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight
    sum_less_or_equal_w = sum(q) <= w
    
    # Return true if both conditions are met
    return is_balanced && sum_less_or_equal_w
end
```

This Julia function `will_it_fly` takes in a vector of integers `q` and an integer `w`, and it returns `true` if the vector is a palindrome and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `w`, otherwise it returns `false`.
