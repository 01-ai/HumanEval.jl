 Here's the implementation of the `same_chars` function in Julia:

```julia
function same_chars(s0::String, s1::String)::Bool
    # Convert both strings to arrays of characters and sort them
    sorted_s0 = sort(collect(s0))
    sorted_s1 = sort(collect(s1))
    
    # Compare the sorted arrays
    return sorted_s0 == sorted_s1
end
```

This function works by converting both input strings to arrays of characters, sorting these arrays, and then comparing the sorted arrays for equality. If the sorted arrays are equal, it means the two strings have the same characters.
