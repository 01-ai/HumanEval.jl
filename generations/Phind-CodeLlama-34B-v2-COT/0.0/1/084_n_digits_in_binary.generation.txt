# Step-by-step outline:

1. First, we need to convert the given integer N into a string to easily access each digit.
2. Then, we will initialize a variable `binary_sum` to store the sum of the digits in binary.
3. We will iterate over each character in the string representation of N.
4. For each character, we will convert it back to an integer and calculate its binary representation.
5. We will add this binary representation to `binary_sum`.
6. After the loop ends, we will return `binary_sum`.

# Code:

```julia
function n_digits_in_binary(N::Int)::String
    # Convert N to a string
    N_str = string(N)
    
    # Initialize binary_sum
    binary_sum = ""
    
    # Iterate over each character in N_str
    for digit in N_str
        # Convert digit back to an integer and calculate its binary representation
        binary_digit = string(digits(parse(Int, digit), base=2, pad=3))[end-2:end]
        
        # Add binary_digit to binary_sum
        binary_sum *= binary_digit
    end
    
    return binary_sum
end
```

This function works by converting the input integer N to a string, then iterating over each character in the string. For each character, it converts the character back to an integer, calculates its binary representation, and adds this binary representation to a running total `binary_sum`. The function finally returns `binary_sum`.
