Here is a step-by-step outline of how to solve this problem:

1. Convert the decimal number to binary.
2. Convert the binary number to a string.
3. Add the 'db' characters at the beginning and at the end of the string.

Here is the Julia code that implements this solution:

```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    binary = string(decimal, base=2)  # Convert decimal to binary
    return "db" * binary * "db"  # Add 'db' characters at the beginning and at the end
end
```

This function works by first converting the decimal number to binary using the `string` function with `base=2`. This gives us a string representation of the binary number. Then, it adds the 'db' characters at the beginning and at the end of the string using the `*` operator.

For example, if you call `decimal_to_binary(15)`, it will return `"db1111db"`.
