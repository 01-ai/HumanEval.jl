### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Define the function `words_string` that takes a single argument `s` which is a string.
2. Use a regular expression to split the string `s` by commas or spaces. The regular expression should match any sequence of commas and/or spaces.
3. Filter out any empty strings that may result from the split operation, as we don't want to include them in the result.
4. Return the resulting array of words.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function words_string(s::String)::Vector{String}
    # Step 2: Split the string using a regular expression that matches commas and spaces
    words = split(s, r"[, ]+", keepempty=false)
    
    # Step 3: The split function with keepempty=false option already filters out empty strings
    
    # Step 4: Return the array of words
    return words
end
```

Now, let's implement the function in Julia.
