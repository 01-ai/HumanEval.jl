Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function reverse_string(s::String)::String
    if !any(isletter, s)
        return reverse(s)
    end
    return map(c -> isletter(c) ? (isupper(c) ? lowercase(c) : uppercase(c)) : c, s)
end
```

This function works by first checking if the string contains any letters. If it doesn't, it simply reverses the string. If it does contain letters, it maps over each character in the string. If the character is a letter, it reverses its case. If the character is not a letter, it leaves it as is.

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(reverse_string("1234"))  # "4321"
println(reverse_string("ab"))  # "BA"
println(reverse_string("#a@C"))  # "#A@C"
```
