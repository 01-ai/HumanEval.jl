Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    sum = 0
    for x in xs
        if x > 0 && x % 2 != 0
            sum += x^2
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates over each number in the input vector. If the number is positive and odd, it squares the number and adds it to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.
