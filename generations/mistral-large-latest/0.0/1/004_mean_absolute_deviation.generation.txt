Sure, here is the Julia function that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) based on the given docstring:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean_numbers = mean(numbers)

    # Calculate the absolute deviation of each number from the mean
    deviations = abs.(numbers .- mean_numbers)

    # Return the mean of the absolute deviations
    return mean(deviations)
end
```

This function first calculates the mean of the input numbers. Then, it calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean. Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute deviations, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
