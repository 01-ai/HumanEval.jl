Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function sum_squares_round(xs::Vector)::Int
    return sum(x -> floor(Int, x)^2, xs)
end
```

This function uses the `sum` function to sum up the squared elements of the input vector. The `floor` function is used to round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling). The `^` operator is used to square the elements.
