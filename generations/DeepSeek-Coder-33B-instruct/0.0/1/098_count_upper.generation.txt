Here is the Julia function that counts the number of uppercase vowels in odd indices:

```julia
function count_upper(s::String)::Int
    vowels = "AEIOU"
    return count(i -> i % 2 != 0 && s[i] in vowels, 1:length(s))
end
```

This function works by using the `count` function, which counts the number of elements in a collection that satisfy a given condition. The condition is specified as a lambda function `i -> i % 2 != 0 && s[i] in vowels`, which checks if the index `i` is odd and the character at index `i` is an uppercase vowel. The range `1:length(s)` is the collection of indices of the string `s`.
