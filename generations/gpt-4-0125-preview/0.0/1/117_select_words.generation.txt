To implement the `select_words` function as described, we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the input string `s` into words.
2. For each word, count the number of consonants.
3. If the number of consonants matches `n`, add the word to the result list.
4. Return the result list.

Here's how you can implement this in Julia:

```julia
function select_words(s::String, n::Int)::Vector{<:AbstractString}
    # Define a helper function to count consonants in a word
    function count_consonants(word::AbstractString)::Int
        consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ"
        return count(c -> c in consonants, word)
    end

    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)

    # Filter words based on the number of consonants
    filtered_words = filter(word -> count_consonants(word) == n, words)

    return filtered_words
end
```

This function first defines a helper function `count_consonants` that counts the number of consonants in a given word by checking each character against a string of consonants. Then, it splits the input string `s` into words, filters these words based on the number of consonants matching `n`, and returns the filtered list of words.
