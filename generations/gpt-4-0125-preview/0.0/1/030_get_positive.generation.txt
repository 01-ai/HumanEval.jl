```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector)
    # Filter the vector to return only positive numbers
    return filter(x -> x > 0, xs)
end
```

This Julia function `get_positive` takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector containing only the positive numbers from the input vector. It uses the `filter` function, which iterates over each element in the input vector and applies the given condition (`x -> x > 0`) to determine if an element should be included in the output vector.
