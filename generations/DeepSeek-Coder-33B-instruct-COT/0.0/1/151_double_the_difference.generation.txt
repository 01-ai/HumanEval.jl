Here is a step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This will hold the sum of the squares of the odd numbers.
2. Iterate over each number `x` in the input list `xs`.
3. Check if `x` is an integer and is odd. If it is, square it and add it to `sum`.
4. Return `sum`.

Here is the Julia code that implements this function:

```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    sum = 0
    for x in xs
        if x isa Integer && x % 2 != 0
            sum += x^2
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function works by iterating over each number in the input list. If the number is an odd integer, it squares the number and adds it to the sum. The function finally returns the sum.
