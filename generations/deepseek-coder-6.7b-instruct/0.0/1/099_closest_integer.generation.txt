Here is the Julia function that implements the given problem:

```julia
function closest_integer(value::String)::Int
    num = parse(Float64, value)
    if num >= 0
        return Int(round(num))
    else
        return Int(round(num - 0.5 + 0.01))
    end
end
```

This function first converts the string to a float number. If the number is positive or zero, it rounds it to the nearest integer using the `round` function. If the number is negative, it rounds it to the nearest integer, but subtracts 0.5 to ensure that it rounds away from zero. The `0.01` is added to ensure that if the number is exactly halfway between two integers, it rounds up.

You can test this function with the provided examples:

```julia
julia> closest_integer("10")
10

julia> closest_integer("15.3")
15

julia> closest_integer("-14.5")
-15
```
