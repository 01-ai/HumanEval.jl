Sure, here is the Julia function that implements the strange sort algorithm based on the given docstring:

```julia
function strange_sort_list(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Check if the input list is empty
    if isempty(xs)
        return xs
    end

    # Initialize the sorted list
    sorted_list = Int[]

    # While there are still elements in the input list
    while !isempty(xs)
        # Find the minimum element and remove it from the list
        min_elem = findmin(xs)[2]
        deleteat!(xs, min_elem)
        push!(sorted_list, min_elem)

        # If there are still elements in the list, find the maximum element and remove it
        if !isempty(xs)
            max_elem = findmax(xs)[2]
            deleteat!(xs, max_elem)
            push!(sorted_list, max_elem)
        end
    end

    return sorted_list
end
```

This function first checks if the input list is empty. If it is, it simply returns the empty list. Otherwise, it initializes an empty sorted list. It then enters a loop that continues until there are no elements left in the input list. In each iteration of the loop, it finds the minimum element in the list, removes it, and adds it to the sorted list. If there are still elements in the list, it finds the maximum element, removes it, and adds it to the sorted list. Finally, it returns the sorted list.
