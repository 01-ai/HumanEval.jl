# Outline

1. Initialize a variable `max_val` to hold the maximum value found so far, setting it as the first element of the list `xs`.
2. Iterate over the list `xs` starting from the second element (since `max_val` is already initialized with the first one).
3. For each element, compare it with `max_val`. If it's greater, update `max_val` with this new element.
4. After the loop finishes, return `max_val` as the maximum element of the list.

# Code

```julia
function max_element(xs)
    # Step 1: Initialize max_val with the first element of the list
    max_val = xs[1]

    # Step 2: Iterate over the list starting from the second element
    for x in xs[2:end]
        # Step 3: Compare each element with max_val and update max_val if necessary
        if x > max_val
            max_val = x
        end
    end

    # Step 4: Return the maximum element
    return max_val
end
```
