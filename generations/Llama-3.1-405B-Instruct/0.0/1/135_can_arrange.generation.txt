Here is the Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:
```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    for i in length(xs):-1:2
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            return i
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We iterate over the input vector `xs` in reverse order, starting from the last element and moving towards the first element.
* We check if the current element `xs[i]` is less than the previous element `xs[i-1]`. If this condition is true, it means we've found an element that is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it.
* If we find such an element, we return its index `i`.
* If we reach the beginning of the vector without finding such an element, we return -1, indicating that no such element exists.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring:
```julia
julia> can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5])
4

julia> can_arrange([1, 2, 3])
-1
```
