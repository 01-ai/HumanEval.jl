This function takes a vector `xs` representing the coefficients of a polynomial and calculates the derivative of the polynomial by applying the formula for the derivative of a polynomial term: `d/dx (x^i) = i*x^(i-1)`. The function returns a vector of the derivative coefficients in the same form as the original polynomial.
