Sure, here is the Julia function based on your docstring:

```julia
function file_name_check(file_name::String)::String
    # Check if there are more than three digits
    if count(isdigit, file_name) > 3
        return "No"
    end

    # Check if there is exactly one dot
    if count(==('.'), file_name) != 1
        return "No"
    end

    # Split the string into two parts: before and after the dot
    split_name = split(file_name, ".")

    # Check if the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter
    if isempty(split_name[1]) || !isletter(split_name[1][1])
        return "No"
    end

    # Check if the substring after the dot is one of the allowed extensions
    if split_name[2] âˆ‰ ["txt", "exe", "dll"]
        return "No"
    end

    # If all checks pass, the filename is valid
    return "Yes"
end
```
This function should work as per your specifications. It checks each condition in order and returns "No" as soon as it finds an invalid condition. If it gets through all the checks, it returns "Yes", indicating that the filename is valid.
