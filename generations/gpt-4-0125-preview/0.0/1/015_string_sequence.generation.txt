```julia
function string_sequence(n::Int)::String
    # Create a range from 0 to n
    num_range = 0:n
    
    # Convert each number in the range to a string and join them with spaces
    return join(string.(num_range), " ")
end
```

This function starts by creating a range from 0 to `n` inclusive. It then converts each number in this range to a string using the `string` function. Finally, it joins these string representations with spaces to form the final result.
