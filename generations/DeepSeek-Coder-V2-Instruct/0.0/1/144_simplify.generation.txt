 Here's the implementation of the `simplify` function in Julia:

```julia
function simplify(x::String, n::String)::Bool
    # Parse the fractions
    num_x, denom_x = parse.(Int, split(x, "/"))
    num_n, denom_n = parse.(Int, split(n, "/"))
    
    # Calculate the product of the two fractions
    product_num = num_x * num_n
    product_denom = denom_x * denom_n
    
    # Check if the product is a whole number
    return product_num % product_denom == 0
end
```

This function first parses the input strings to extract the numerators and denominators. It then calculates the numerator and denominator of the product of the two fractions. Finally, it checks if the numerator of the product is divisible by the denominator, indicating that the product is a whole number.
