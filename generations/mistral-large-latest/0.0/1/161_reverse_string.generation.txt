Sure, here is the Julia function that fulfills the requirements:

```julia
function reverse_string(s::String)::String
    let = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    res = ""
    rev = false

    for c in s
        if c in let
            rev = true
            res *= (c == lowercase(c) ? uppercase(c) : lowercase(c))
        else
            res *= c
        end
    end

    if !rev
        res = reverse(res)
    end

    return res
end
```

This function iterates over each character in the string. If the character is a letter, it changes the case and adds it to the result string. If the character is not a letter, it adds it to the result string as is. If no letters are found in the string, it reverses the string.
