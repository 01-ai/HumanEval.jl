function triangle_area(a, h)
    """
    Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.

    # Examples

    ```jldoctest
    julia> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    ```
    """
    return a * h / 2
end
```

This function calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side and the height. The area of a triangle is calculated using the formula `A = (a * h) / 2`, where `a` is the length of a side and `h` is the height.
