To implement the `rescale_to_unit` function as described, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the minimum and maximum values in the input vector.
2. Subtract the minimum value from each element in the vector to ensure the smallest number becomes 0.
3. Divide each element by the difference between the maximum and minimum values to ensure the largest number becomes 1.
4. Return the transformed vector.

Here's how you can implement this in Julia:

```julia
function rescale_to_unit(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Vector{Float64}
    # Step 1: Find the minimum and maximum values
    min_val = minimum(numbers)
    max_val = maximum(numbers)

    # Step 2 & 3: Subtract the minimum and divide by the range (max - min)
    # to rescale numbers to the unit interval [0, 1]
    return [(x - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for x in numbers]
end

# Example usage
println(rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]))
```

This function first calculates the minimum and maximum values in the input vector. Then, it uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in the input vector, subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range (maximum - minimum) to scale the values to the unit interval [0, 1].
