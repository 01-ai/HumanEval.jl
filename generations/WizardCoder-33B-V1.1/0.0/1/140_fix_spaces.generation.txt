Here is the Julia function that implements the required functionality:

```julia
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")
    s = replace(s, "__" => "-")
    if s[1] == '_'
        s = s[2:end]
    end
    return s
end
```

This function works by first replacing all spaces with underscores, then replacing all double underscores with a single dash. If the first character of the resulting string is an underscore, it is removed.
