Here's a solution to find the minimum path of length `k` in a grid:

```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = length(grid)
    best_path = fill(N * N + 1, k)
    
    function dfs(i, j, path, length)
        if length == k
            if path < best_path
                best_path[:] = path
            end
            return
        end
        
        for (di, dj) in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 1 <= ni <= N && 1 <= nj <= N
                path[length + 1] = grid[ni][nj]
                dfs(ni, nj, path, length + 1)
            end
        end
    end
    
    for i in 1:N
        for j in 1:N
            path = fill(0, k)
            path[1] = grid[i][j]
            dfs(i, j, path, 1)
        end
    end
    
    return best_path
end
```

The idea is to use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from each cell in the grid. We keep track of the current best path found so far in the `best_path` array.

The `dfs` function performs the DFS traversal. It takes the current cell indices `i` and `j`, the current `path` array, and the current `length` of the path. If the current path length reaches `k`, we compare it with the `best_path` and update `best_path` if the current path is lexicographically smaller.

In each DFS step, we explore the neighboring cells by adding the offsets `(0, 1)`, `(0, -1)`, `(1, 0)`, and `(-1, 0)` to the current cell indices. We ensure that the new indices are within the grid boundaries. If a neighboring cell is valid, we add its value to the current path and recursively call `dfs` with the updated indices and path length.

We start the DFS traversal from each cell in the grid by initializing the `path` array with the cell value and calling `dfs` with the initial indices, path, and length.

Finally, we return the `best_path` array, which represents the minimum path of length `k` in the grid.

The time complexity of this solution is O(4^k * N^2), as we explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from each cell in the grid. The space complexity is O(k) for the recursion stack and the `path` array.

Note: This solution assumes that the input grid is valid and contains unique values from 1 to N * N inclusive.
