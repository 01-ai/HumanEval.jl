Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    return xs .+ 1
end
```

This function uses the broadcasting feature of Julia to increment each element in the input vector by 1. The `.+` operator is used to add 1 to each element of the vector. The result is a new vector with the incremented elements.
