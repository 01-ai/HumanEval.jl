```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case differences
    lower_s = lowercase(s)
    
    # Use a Set to store unique characters
    unique_chars = Set(lower_s)
    
    # Return the number of unique characters
    return length(unique_chars)
end
```

This function first converts the input string to lowercase to ensure that character comparison is case-insensitive. It then uses a `Set` to store unique characters, as sets automatically handle duplicates. Finally, it returns the number of elements in the set, which corresponds to the number of distinct characters in the input string.
