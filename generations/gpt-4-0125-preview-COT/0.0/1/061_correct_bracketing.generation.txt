### Outline for `correct_bracketing` Function

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Start with a counter set to 0. This counter will keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets.

2. **Iterate Through the String**: Loop through each character in the string.

    a. **If an Opening Bracket is Found**: Increment the counter by 1.
    
    b. **If a Closing Bracket is Found**: Decrement the counter by 1.
    
    c. **Check for Early Closure**: If at any point the counter becomes negative, return `false`. This indicates a closing bracket appeared before its corresponding opening bracket.
    
3. **Final Check**: After the loop, if the counter is 0, this means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and we return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

4. **Return Result**: The function returns `true` if the string has correct bracketing, otherwise `false`.

### Julia Code for `correct_bracketing`

```julia
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    # Step 1: Initialize a counter
    counter = 0
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the string
    for bracket in brackets
        # Step 2a: If an opening bracket is found
        if bracket == '('
            counter += 1
        # Step 2b: If a closing bracket is found
        elseif bracket == ')'
            counter -= 1
            # Step 2c: Check for early closure
            if counter < 0
                return false
            end
        end
    end
    
    # Step 3: Final check
    return counter == 0
end
```

This function efficiently checks for correct bracketing by ensuring that for every opening bracket, there is a corresponding closing bracket, and no closing bracket appears before its matching opening bracket.
