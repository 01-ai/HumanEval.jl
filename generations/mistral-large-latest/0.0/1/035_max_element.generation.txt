Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple implementation of the `max_element` function in Julia based on your docstring:

```julia
function max_element(xs::Vector{<:Real})
    isempty(xs) && error("The list cannot be empty")
    return maximum(xs)
end
```

This function takes a vector of real numbers as input and returns the maximum element. If the input vector is empty, it throws an error. The `maximum` function is a built-in Julia function that returns the maximum element in a collection.
