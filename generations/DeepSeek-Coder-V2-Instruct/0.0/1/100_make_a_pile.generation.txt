 Here's the implementation of the `make_a_pile` function in Julia:

```julia
function make_a_pile(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    pile = Vector{Int}(undef, n)
    pile[1] = n
    for i in 2:n
        if n % 2 == 0
            pile[i] = pile[i-1] + 2
        else
            pile[i] = pile[i-1] + 2
        end
    end
    return pile
end
```

This function initializes a vector `pile` with `n` elements. The first element is set to `n`. For each subsequent level, it adds 2 to the previous level's number of stones, which ensures that the sequence alternates between odd and even numbers as required.
