```julia
function encrypt(s::String)
    # Define the alphabet and the encrypted alphabet
    const alpha = 'a':'z'
    const enc_alpha = ['a' + (mod((i + 4), 26)) for i in 0:25]

    # Convert the string to lowercase and map each character to its encrypted counterpart
    encrypted = map(c -> c in alpha ? enc_alpha[c - 'a' + 1] : c, lowercase(s))

    # Join the encrypted characters back into a string
    return join(encrypted)
end
