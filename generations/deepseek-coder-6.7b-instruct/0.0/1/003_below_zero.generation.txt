Here is a simple Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function below_zero(operations::Vector{Int})::Bool
    balance = 0
    for op in operations
        balance += op
        if balance < 0
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This function starts with a balance of zero and iterates over the operations. For each operation, it adds the value to the balance. If at any point the balance is less than zero, the function immediately returns `true`. If the function finishes without finding a negative balance, it returns `false`.
