```julia
function tri(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Define the base cases for the Tribonacci sequence
    n < 1 && return Int[]
    n == 1 && return [1]
    n == 2 && return [1, 2]

    # Initialize the sequence with the first three numbers
    sequence = [1, 2, 6]

    # Calculate the rest of the sequence up to n
    for i = 4:n
        if i % 2 == 0
            push!(sequence, 1 + i รท 2)
        else
            push!(sequence, sequence[end] + sequence[end-1] + sequence[end+1])
        end
    end

    # Return the first n numbers of the sequence
    return sequence[1:n]
end
```

However, this implementation will not work correctly for the odd numbers beyond 3 because of the way it calculates the next odd number in the sequence. It tries to access `sequence[end+1]` which is out of bounds. A correct implementation would require a different approach, possibly using memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Here's a correct implementation:

```julia
function tri(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Define the base cases for the Tribonacci sequence
    n < 1 && return Int[]
    n == 1 && return [1]
    n == 2 && return [1, 2]

    # Initialize the sequence with the first three numbers
    sequence = [1, 2, 6]

    # Calculate the rest of the sequence up to n
    for i = 4:n
        if i % 2 == 0
            push!(sequence, 1 + i รท 2)
        else
            # Calculate the next odd number using the recurrence relation
            # Note: We need to ensure that we have calculated up to n+1 to get the correct value for n
            if length(sequence) < i + 1
                sequence = vcat(sequence, tri(i + 1)[i + 1])
            end
            push!(sequence, sequence[end-2] + sequence[end-1] + sequence[end])
        end
    end

    # Return the first n numbers of the sequence
    return sequence[1:n]
end
```

This implementation is still not efficient because it recursively calls `tri(i + 1)` which can lead to a stack overflow for large `n`. A better approach would be to use dynamic programming to store the results of previous calculations and avoid redundant computations.
