Here's the implementation of the `count_nums` function in Julia:

```julia
function count_nums(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    count = 0
    for num in xs
        sum_digits = 0
        abs_num = abs(num)
        while abs_num > 0
            sum_digits += abs_num % 10 * (num < 0 ? -1 : 1)
            abs_num รท= 10
        end
        if sum_digits > 0
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates over each number in the input vector `xs`, calculates the sum of its signed digits, and increments the count if the sum is greater than 0. The sum of signed digits is calculated by taking the absolute value of the number, iterating through its digits, and adjusting the sign based on whether the original number was negative.
