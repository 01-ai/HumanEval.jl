```julia
function sum_squares_round(xs::Vector)::Int
    # Round each element in the list to the nearest integer (Ceiling)
    rounded_xs = ceil.(Int, xs)
    
    # Square each rounded number and then sum them up
    sum_squares = sum(rounded_xs .^ 2)
    
    return sum_squares
end
```

This function first rounds each element in the input vector `xs` to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function, ensuring we follow the Ceiling rounding rule. Then, it squares each rounded number using the dot operation `.^` for element-wise exponentiation and finally calculates the sum of these squared values. The result is returned as an integer.
