Here is the Julia function that implements the given problem:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector{Int})::Int
    freq = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for num in numbers
        freq[num] = get(freq, num, 0) + 1
    end
    max_freq = maximum(values(freq))
    for (num, count) in freq
        if count >= num && count == max_freq
            return num
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```

This function first counts the frequency of each number in the input list. Then it iterates over the frequency dictionary to find the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. If no such a value exists, it returns -1.
