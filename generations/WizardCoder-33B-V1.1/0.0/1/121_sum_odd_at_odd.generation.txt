Here is the Julia function that implements the above doc string:

```julia
function sum_odd_at_odd(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:2:length(xs)
        if xs[i] % 2 != 0
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function works by iterating over the elements of the input vector `xs` in steps of 2 (i.e., it only considers the elements at odd positions). If an element is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is not 0), it is added to the sum. The function finally returns the sum of all such elements.
