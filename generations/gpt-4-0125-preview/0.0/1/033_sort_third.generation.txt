To implement the `sort_third` function as described, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the indices that are divisible by three. Note that in Julia, array indices start at 1, so we need to adjust our condition accordingly.
2. Extract the values at these indices.
3. Sort these extracted values.
4. Replace the original values at these indices with the sorted values.
5. Return the modified list.

Here's how you can implement this in Julia:

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Step 1: Identify indices divisible by three (adjusting for Julia's 1-based indexing)
    divisible_by_three_indices = 3:3:length(l)
    
    # Step 2: Extract values at these indices
    values_to_sort = [l[i] for i in divisible_by_three_indices]
    
    # Step 3: Sort these values
    sorted_values = sort(values_to_sort)
    
    # Step 4: Replace original values with sorted values
    for (i, index) in enumerate(divisible_by_three_indices)
        l[index] = sorted_values[i]
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return the modified list
    return l
end
```

This function works as follows:
- It first calculates the indices that are divisible by three, taking into account Julia's 1-based indexing.
- It then extracts the values at these indices into a separate list.
- This list is sorted.
- The sorted values are placed back into the original list at the corresponding indices.
- Finally, the modified list is returned.
