Here is a Julia function that implements the `will_it_fly` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the list is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = q == reverse(q)

    # Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight
    sum_less_than_w = sum(q) <= w

    # Return true if the list is a palindrome and the sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight, false otherwise
    return is_palindrome && sum_less_than_w
end
```

This function first checks if the input list `q` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. It then checks if the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. If both conditions are met, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
