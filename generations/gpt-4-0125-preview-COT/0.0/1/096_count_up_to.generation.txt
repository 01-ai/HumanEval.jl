### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Check for Base Cases**: If `n` is less than 2, return an empty array since there are no prime numbers less than 2.

2. **Initialize an Empty Array**: This will store the prime numbers found.

3. **Iterate through Numbers**: Loop through numbers from 2 up to (but not including) `n`. For each number, check if it is prime.

4. **Check for Primality**:
    - For the current number in the loop, check if it is prime by trying to divide it by all smaller numbers greater than 1 and less than itself.
    - If the number is only divisible by 1 and itself (i.e., it has no divisors other than 1 and itself), it is prime.

5. **Add Prime Numbers to Array**: If a number is found to be prime, add it to the array initialized in step 2.

6. **Return the Array**: Once the loop is complete, return the array containing all the prime numbers found.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function count_up_to(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Step 1: Check for base cases
    if n < 2
        return Int[]
    end
    
    # Step 2: Initialize an empty array for prime numbers
    primes = Int[]
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through numbers from 2 to n-1
    for num in 2:n-1
        # Step 4: Check for primality
        is_prime = true
        for divisor in 2:sqrt(num)
            if num % divisor == 0
                is_prime = false
                break
            end
        end
        
        # Step 5: Add prime numbers to array
        if is_prime
            push!(primes, num)
        end
    end
    
    # Step 6: Return the array of prime numbers
    return primes
end
```

This function efficiently finds and returns all prime numbers less than `n` by checking each number for primality and collecting the prime numbers in an array. The use of `sqrt(num)` in the divisor loop optimizes the primality check, as a non-prime number will have at least one divisor less than or equal to its square root.
