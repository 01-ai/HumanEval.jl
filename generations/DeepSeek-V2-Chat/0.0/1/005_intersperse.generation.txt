Here's the implementation of the `intersperse` function in Julia:

```julia
function intersperse(numbers::Vector{Int}, delimeter::Int)::Vector{Int}
    result = Vector{Int}()
    for i in 1:length(numbers)
        push!(result, numbers[i])
        if i < length(numbers)
            push!(result, delimeter)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function iterates through the input vector `numbers` and appends each element to the `result` vector. After appending each element (except the last one), it also appends the `delimeter` to the `result` vector. This way, the `delimeter` is inserted between every two consecutive elements of the input list.
