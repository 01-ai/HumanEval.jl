To solve this problem, we can use the built-in function `digits` in Julia, which converts a given number to an array of its digits. Then, we can map each digit to its binary representation and join them together.

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Use the `digits` function to convert the decimal number to an array of its digits.
2. Map each digit to its binary representation using the `string` function and `base` argument.
3. Join the binary digits together using the `join` function.
4. Add "db" at the beginning and end of the resulting string.

And here is the Julia code:

```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    # Convert the decimal number to an array of its digits
    digits_array = digits(decimal)

    # Map each digit to its binary representation and join them together
    binary_string = join(map(x -> string(x, base = 2, pad = 4), digits_array))

    # Add "db" at the beginning and end of the string
    result = "db" * binary_string * "db"

    return result
end
```

This function works by first converting the decimal number to an array of its digits. Then, it maps each digit to its binary representation and joins them together into a string. Finally, it adds "db" at the beginning and end of the string and returns the result.
