To implement the `special_factorial` function as described, we will follow these steps:

1. Check if the input `n` is greater than 0. If not, we can return an error or a specific value indicating invalid input.
2. Calculate the factorial of each number from `n` down to 1.
3. Multiply all these factorials together to get the Brazilian factorial.
4. Return the result.

Here's how the implementation looks in Julia:

```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    # Step 1: Check if n is valid
    if n <= 0
        throw(ArgumentError("n must be greater than 0"))
    end
    
    # Initialize the result as BigInt to handle large numbers
    result = BigInt(1)
    
    # Step 2 and 3: Calculate the factorial of each number from n to 1 and multiply them
    for i in 1:n
        factorial_i = BigInt(1)
        for j in 1:i
            factorial_i *= j
        end
        result *= factorial_i
    end
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return result
end

# Example usage
println(special_factorial(4))  # Expected output: 288
```

This function calculates the factorial of each number from `n` to 1 using a nested loop and multiplies them together. The use of `BigInt` ensures that the function can handle very large numbers without integer overflow.
