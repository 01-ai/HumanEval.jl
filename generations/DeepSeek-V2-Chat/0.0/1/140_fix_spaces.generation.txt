Here's the implementation of the `fix_spaces` function in Julia:

```julia
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # Replace all consecutive spaces with a placeholder
    s = replace(s, r" {2,}" => "-")
    # Replace all remaining spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")
    return s
end
```

This function first replaces all occurrences of two or more consecutive spaces with a single hyphen (`-`). Then, it replaces all remaining single spaces with underscores (`_`). This approach ensures that the transformation is done correctly according to the specified rules.
