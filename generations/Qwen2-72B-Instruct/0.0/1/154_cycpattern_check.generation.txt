```julia
function cycpattern_check(a::String, b::String)::Bool
    # Concatenate the first string with itself to handle rotations
    concatenated_a = a * a
    # Check if b is a substring of the concatenated string
    return occursin(b, concatenated_a)
end
```

This function works by concatenating the first string `a` with itself. This way, any rotation of `a` will be a substring of the concatenated string. Then, it checks if `b` is a substring of this concatenated string. If `b` is found, it means that `b` is either a substring of `a` or a rotation of `a`, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. However, this approach does not directly check for rotations of `b`, so we need to modify it slightly to accommodate the problem's requirements.

Here's an updated version that checks for rotations of `b`:

```julia
function cycpattern_check(a::String, b::String)::Bool
    # Check if b is a substring of a
    if occursin(b, a)
        return true
    end
    # Generate all rotations of b and check if any is a substring of a
    for i in 1:length(b)
        rotated_b = b[i:end] * b[1:i-1]
        if occursin(rotated_b, a)
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This version of the function first checks if `b` is a substring of `a`. If not, it generates all possible rotations of `b` by rotating the string one character at a time and checks if any of these rotations is a substring of `a`. If any rotation is found to be a substring, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false` after checking all rotations.
