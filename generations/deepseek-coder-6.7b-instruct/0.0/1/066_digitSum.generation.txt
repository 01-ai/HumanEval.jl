Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function digitSum(s::String)::Int
    sum = 0
    for c in s
        if isupper(c)
            sum += Int(c)
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an uppercase letter (checked using the `isupper` function), its ASCII value is added to the sum. The sum is then returned.
