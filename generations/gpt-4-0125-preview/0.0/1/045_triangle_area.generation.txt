```julia
function triangle_area(a::Number, h::Number)
    return 0.5 * a * h
end
```

This function calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side (`a`) and the height (`h`) perpendicular to that side. The area of a triangle is given by the formula \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \), which is implemented in this function.
