Here is a Julia function that implements the algorithm described in the doc string:

```julia
function palindrome_with_append(s::String)::String
    n = length(s)
    rev_s = reverse(s)
    for i in 0:n-1
        if s[1:n-i] == rev_s[i+1:end]
            return s * rev_s[1:i]
        end
    end
    return s * rev_s
end
```

This function works by iterating over the string in reverse order, checking if the current substring is a palindrome. If it is, it appends the reverse of the remaining part of the string to the end of the string. If no palindrome is found, it simply returns the string appended with its reverse.

Here is how you can test this function:

```julia
println(palindrome_with_append("")) # ""
println(palindrome_with_append("cat")) # "catac"
println(palindrome_with_append("cata")) # "catac"
```
