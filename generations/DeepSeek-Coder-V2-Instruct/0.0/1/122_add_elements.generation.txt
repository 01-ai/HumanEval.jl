 Here's the implementation of the `add_elements` function in Julia:

```julia
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    # Initialize the sum
    sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over the first k elements of xs
    for i in 1:k
        # Check if the element has at most two digits
        if xs[i] >= -99 && xs[i] <= 99
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end
    
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates over the first `k` elements of the input vector `xs`, checks if each element has at most two digits (i.e., is between -99 and 99 inclusive), and adds it to the sum if it does. Finally, it returns the computed sum.
