Here's the implementation of the `pairs_sum_to_zero` function in Julia:

```julia
function pairs_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    seen = Set{Int}()
    for num in l
        if -num in seen
            return true
        end
        push!(seen, num)
    end
    return false
end
```

This function uses a set to keep track of the numbers we've seen so far. For each number in the list, it checks if the negation of that number is already in the set. If it is, that means we've found two distinct elements that sum to zero, and the function returns `true`. If we go through the entire list without finding such a pair, the function returns `false`.
