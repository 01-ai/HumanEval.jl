Here is the implementation of the `will_it_fly` function in Julia:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    return q == reverse(q) && sum(q) <= w
end
```

This function checks if the input list `q` is balanced by comparing it with its reverse. It also checks if the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. If both conditions are true, the function returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.
