```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the sorted list
    l_sorted = Vector{eltype(l)}(undef, length(l))

    # Loop through the indices of the list
    for i in eachindex(l)
        # If the index is divisible by 3, sort the elements at those indices
        if i % 3 == 0
            # Get the indices of elements to be sorted
            inds_to_sort = findall(x -> x % 3 == 0, eachindex(l))
            # Sort the elements at those indices
            l_sorted[inds_to_sort] = sort(l[inds_to_sort])
        # Otherwise, copy the element from the original list
        else
            l_sorted[i] = l[i]
        end
    end

    # Return the sorted list
    return l_sorted
end
```

This function works by iterating over each index of the input list `l`. For indices that are divisible by 3, it finds all such indices and sorts the elements at those indices. For all other indices, it simply copies the element from the original list. The sorted list is then returned.
