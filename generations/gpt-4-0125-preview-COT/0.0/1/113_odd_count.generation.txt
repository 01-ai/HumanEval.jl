### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize an empty vector** to store the result strings.
2. **Iterate through each string** in the input vector.
    - For each string, **count the number of odd digits** it contains.
    - **Construct the result string** for the current string by replacing the placeholder `i` with the count of odd digits.
    - **Append the constructed string** to the result vector.
3. **Return the result vector** containing the formatted strings.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function odd_count(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty vector for the result
    result = Vector{String}()
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through each string in the input vector
    for x in xs
        # Count the number of odd digits in the current string
        odd_count = count(digit -> isodd(parse(Int, digit)), collect(x))
        
        # Construct the result string with the odd count replacing 'i'
        result_string = replace("the number of odd elements in the string i of the input.",
                                "i" => string(odd_count))
        
        # Append the constructed string to the result vector
        push!(result, result_string)
    end
    
    # Step 3: Return the result vector
    return result
end
```

This function iterates through each string in the input vector, counts the number of odd digits in each string, and constructs a result string with the count of odd digits replacing the placeholder `i`. The constructed strings are collected in a result vector, which is returned at the end.
