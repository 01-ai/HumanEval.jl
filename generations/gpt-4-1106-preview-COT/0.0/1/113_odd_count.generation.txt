To implement the `odd_count` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `odd_count` that takes a vector of strings `xs` as input.
2. Initialize an empty vector of strings `result` to store the output.
3. Loop through each string in the input vector `xs`.
4. For each string, count the number of odd digits.
5. Create the output string by replacing the letter 'i' with the number of odd digits found in step 4.
6. Append the output string to the `result` vector.
7. Return the `result` vector after the loop ends.

Now, let's write the code for the `odd_count` function.
