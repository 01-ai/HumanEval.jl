 Here's the implementation of the `fruit_distribution` function in Julia:

```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Extract the number of apples and oranges from the string
    apples = match(r"(\d+) apples", s)
    oranges = match(r"(\d+) oranges", s)
    
    # Convert the matched strings to integers
    num_apples = apples !== nothing ? parse(Int, apples.captures[1]) : 0
    num_oranges = oranges !== nothing ? parse(Int, oranges.captures[1]) : 0
    
    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    num_mangoes = n - num_apples - num_oranges
    
    return num_mangoes
end
```

This function uses regular expressions to extract the number of apples and oranges from the input string. It then calculates the number of mangoes by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits.
