### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Define a function `strlen` that takes a single argument `x` of type `String`.
2. Use the built-in Julia function `length` to calculate the length of the string `x`.
3. Return the length as an integer.

### Julia Code:

```julia
"""
    strlen(x::String)::Int

Return length of given string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> strlen("")
0

julia> strlen("abc")
3
```
"""
function strlen(x::String)::Int
    return length(x)
end
```

This function is straightforward since Julia provides a built-in function `length` to get the length of a string. The type annotation `::Int` is not strictly necessary because `length` will always return an integer, but it's included here to match the function signature specified in the doc string.
