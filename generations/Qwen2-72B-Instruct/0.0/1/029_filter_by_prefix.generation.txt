Here is the Julia function that implements the functionality described in the docstring:

```julia
function filter_by_prefix(xs::Vector{String}, prefix::String)::Vector{String}
    return filter(x -> startswith(x, prefix), xs)
end
```

This function uses the `filter` function from Julia's standard library to create a new array that contains only the elements from `xs` that start with the specified `prefix`. The `startswith` function is used as the predicate to determine if an element should be included in the filtered list.
