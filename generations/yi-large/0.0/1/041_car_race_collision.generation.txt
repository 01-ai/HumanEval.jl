function car_race_collision(n::Int)::Int
    # Since the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, and they continue moving
    # in their trajectory as if they did not collide, every car moving left to
    # right will collide with every car moving right to left.
    # Therefore, the number of collisions is simply the product of the number
    # of cars in each direction.

end

# Example usage:
# julia> car_race_collision(3)
# 9

# This means that if there are 3 cars moving in each direction, there will be 9 collisions.
