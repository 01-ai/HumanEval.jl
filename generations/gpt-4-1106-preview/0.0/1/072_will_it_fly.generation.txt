Here's the Julia function `will_it_fly` that matches the doc string description:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the list is palindromic
    is_palindromic = q == reverse(q)
    
    # Check if the sum of elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight
    sum_within_limit = sum(q) <= w
    
    # The object will fly if it's balanced and the sum is within the limit
    return is_palindromic && sum_within_limit
end

# Examples
println(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # false
println(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # false
println(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # true
println(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # true
```

You can copy this function into your Julia environment and run the examples to verify that it works as expected.
