  Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_by_substring` function in Julia:
```
function filter_by_substring(strings::Vector{String}, substring::AbstractString)::Vector{String}
    return filter(s -> occursin(substring, s), strings)
end
```
This function uses the `filter` function from the `Base` module to filter the input vector of strings based on the presence of the given substring. The `occursin` function is used to check if the substring is present in each string.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
julia> filter_by_substring(["abc", "bacd", "cde", "array"], "a")
3-element Vector{String}:
 "abc"
 "bacd"
 "array"
```
This returns a vector of strings that contain the substring "a".
