Sure, I can help with that. However, I want to point out that Julia already has a built-in function `length()` to get the length of a string. But, if you want to create a custom function, here it is:

```julia
"""
    strlen(x::String)::Int

Return length of given string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> strlen("")
0

julia> strlen("abc")
3
```
"""
strlen(x::String)::Int = length(x)
```

This function takes a string as an argument and returns its length as an integer. The function uses Julia's built-in `length()` function to determine the string's length. The docstring you provided is included to provide information about the function's usage and behavior.
