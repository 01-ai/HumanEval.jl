Here's the Julia function `move_one_ball` that implements the logic described in the docstring:

```julia
function move_one_ball(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # If the array is empty or has only one element, it is already sorted.
    if length(xs) <= 1
        return true
    end

    # Count the number of times the sequence decreases.
    decrease_count = 0
    decrease_index = -1

    for i in 1:(length(xs) - 1)
        if xs[i] > xs[i + 1]
            decrease_count += 1
            decrease_index = i
        end
    end

    # Check the last and first element to handle the circular case.
    if xs[end] > xs[1]
        decrease_count += 1
        decrease_index = length(xs)
    end

    # If there is more than one decrease, it's not possible to sort by right shifts.
    if decrease_count > 1
        return false
    end

    # If there is no decrease or exactly one, it's possible to sort by right shifts.
    return true
end
```

This function checks the number of times the sequence decreases. If there is more than one decrease, it's not possible to sort the array by right shifts. If there is no decrease or exactly one, it's possible to sort the array by right shifts. The function also handles the circular case by checking the last and first elements of the array.
