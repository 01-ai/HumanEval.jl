 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `is_bored` function in Julia based on the given doc string:

```julia
"""
    is_bored(s::String)::Int

You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number of
boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I". Sentences are
delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> is_bored("Hello world")
0

julia> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
1
```
"""
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences based on the delimiters '.', '?', '!'
    sentences = split(s, r"[.!?]")

    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0

    # Iterate through each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Trim leading and trailing whitespace from the sentence
        trimmed_sentence = strip(sentence)

        # Check if the sentence starts with the word "I"
        if startswith(trimmed_sentence, "I ")
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end

    return boredom_count
end

# Test cases
println(is_bored("Hello world")) # Expected output: 0
println(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")) # Expected output: 1
```

This function splits the input string into sentences using the delimiters `.`, `?`, and `!`. It then checks each sentence to see if it starts with the word "I" (followed by a space) and counts such occurrences. The final count is returned as the result.
