Here's a solution to the problem in Julia:

```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    stack = []

    for char in brackets
        if char == '<'
            push!(stack, char)
        elseif char == '>'
            if isempty(stack)
                return false
            else
                pop!(stack)
            end
        end
    end

    return isempty(stack)
end
```

Explanation:
1. We initialize an empty stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.

2. We iterate through each character in the `brackets` string:
   - If the character is an opening bracket ('<'), we push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket ('>'), we check if the stack is empty:
     - If the stack is empty, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket, so we return `false`.
     - If the stack is not empty, we pop the top element from the stack, indicating a matching pair of brackets.

3. After iterating through all the characters, we check if the stack is empty:
   - If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets, so we return `true`.
   - If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets remaining, so we return `false`.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `brackets` string, as we iterate through each character once. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, as the stack may store up to n/2 opening brackets if all the brackets are opening brackets.

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
julia> correct_angle_bracketing("<")
false

julia> correct_angle_bracketing("<>")
true

julia> correct_angle_bracketing("<<><>>")
true

julia> correct_angle_bracketing("><<>")
false
```

The function will return the expected results for each example.
