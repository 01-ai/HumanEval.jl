To implement the `reverse_string` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Check if the string contains any letters. If not, return the reversed string.
2. If the string contains letters, iterate through each character of the string.
3. For each character, check if it is a letter.
4. If it is a letter, reverse its case (convert uppercase to lowercase and vice versa).
5. If it is not a letter, keep it as it is.
6. Concatenate the modified characters to form the new string.
7. Return the new string.

Now, let's write the code for the `reverse_string` function following the outline above.
