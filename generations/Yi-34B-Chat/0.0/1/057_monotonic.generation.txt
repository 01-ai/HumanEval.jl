```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    # Check if the list is empty or contains only one element
    if length(l) <= 1
        return true
    end

    # Check if the list is monotonically increasing
    for i in 2:length(l)
        if l[i] <= l[i-1]
            return false
        end
    end

    # Check if the list is monotonically decreasing
    for i in length(l):-1:2
        if l[i] >= l[i-1]
            return false
        end
    end

    # If we reach this point, the list is either
    # monotonically increasing or decreasing
    return true
end
```

This function `monotonic` takes a vector `l` as input and returns `true` if the elements of the list are monotonically increasing or decreasing. It does this by checking if each element in the list is greater than or equal to the previous element for an increasing sequence, or less than or equal to the previous element for a decreasing sequence. If at any point a violation of the monotonic condition is found, the function returns `false`.
