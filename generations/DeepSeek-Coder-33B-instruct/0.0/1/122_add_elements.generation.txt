Here is a Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    sum(x for x in xs[1:k] if x < 100)
end
```

This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the first `k` elements of `xs` and only includes the elements that are less than 100 in the sum. The `sum` function then adds up these elements.

Let's test the function with the example provided:

```julia
julia> add_elements([111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4)
24
```

This result is as expected.
