To solve this problem, we will first convert the string to a float, then we will round it to the nearest integer. However, we need to round it away from zero, so we will use the `round` function with the `RoundAwayFromZero` rounding mode.

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Define the function `closest_integer` that takes a string `value` as input.
2. Convert the string `value` to a float using the `parse` function.
3. Use the `round` function with the `RoundAwayFromZero` rounding mode to round the float to the nearest integer.
4. Return the rounded integer.

And here is the Julia code:

```julia
function closest_integer(value::String)::Int
    # Convert the string to a float
    num = parse(Float64, value)
    
    # Round the float to the nearest integer away from zero
    rounded_num = round(num, RoundAwayFromZero)
    
    # Return the rounded integer
    return rounded_num
end
```

This function should work for all valid inputs according to the problem description. However, it may throw an error if the input string cannot be converted to a float.
