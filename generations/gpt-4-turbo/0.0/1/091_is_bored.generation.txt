```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences based on '.', '?', '!'
    sentences = split(s, r"[.?!]")
    
    # Initialize boredom count
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Strip leading and trailing whitespace
        trimmed_sentence = strip(sentence)
        
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I" followed by a space or end of sentence
        if startswith(trimmed_sentence, "I ")
            # Increment the boredom count
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end
    
    return boredom_count
end
```

This function `is_bored` takes a string `s` and returns the count of sentences starting with "I". It splits the string into sentences using regular expressions to handle '.', '?', and '!', then iterates through each sentence. If a trimmed sentence starts with "I" followed by a space, it increments the boredom count.
