Here is the Julia function `parse_music` that parses the given music string and returns a vector of integers representing the beats for each note:

```julia
function parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the beats
    beats = Int[]

    # Split the music string into individual notes
    notes = split(music_string, " ")

    # Iterate over each note and determine the number of beats
    for note in notes
        if note == "o"
            push!(beats, 4)  # Whole note, 4 beats
        elseif note == "o|"
            push!(beats, 2)  # Half note, 2 beats
        elseif note == ".|"
            push!(beats, 1)  # Quarter note, 1 beat
        end
    end

    return beats
end

# Example usage
println(parse_music("o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o"))
```

This function first initializes an empty vector to store the beats. It then splits the input string into individual notes using a space as the delimiter. It iterates over each note, checks the note type, and appends the corresponding number of beats to the `beats` vector. Finally, it returns the `beats` vector.
