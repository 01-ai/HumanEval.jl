Here is a step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
2. Iterate over the string `s` with an index `i`.
3. Check if the index `i` is odd and the character at index `i` is an uppercase vowel.
4. If the character is an uppercase vowel, increment the counter.
5. Return the counter.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above steps:

```julia
function count_upper(s::String)::Int
    counter = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(s)
        if i % 2 != 0 && c in "AEIOU"
            counter += 1
        end
    end
    return counter
end
```

This function works by iterating over the string `s` with an index `i` and character `c`. It checks if the index `i` is odd and the character `c` is an uppercase vowel. If both conditions are true, it increments the counter. Finally, it returns the counter.
