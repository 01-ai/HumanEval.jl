```julia
function eat(number::Int, need::Int, remaining::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Check if there are enough remaining carrots
    if remaining >= need - number
        return [number + need, remaining - (need - number)]
    else
        # Not enough remaining carrots, eat all remaining carrots
        return [number + remaining, 0]
    end
end
```

This function checks if there are enough remaining carrots to satisfy the need. If there are, it returns the total number of eaten carrots after the meal and the number of carrots left after the meal. If there are not enough remaining carrots, it eats all remaining carrots and returns the total number of eaten carrots after the meal and 0 for the number of carrots left after the meal.
