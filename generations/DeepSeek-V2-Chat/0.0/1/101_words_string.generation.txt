Here's the implementation of the `words_string` function in Julia:

```julia
function words_string(s::String)::Vector{String}
    # Split the string by both commas and spaces
    words = split(s, r"[,\s]+")
    # Filter out any empty strings
    return filter(word -> !isempty(word), words)
end
```

This function uses a regular expression to split the input string by both commas and spaces, and then filters out any empty strings that might result from consecutive delimiters.
