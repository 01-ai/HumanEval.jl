```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    # Initialize a counter for distinct characters
    distinct_char_count = 0

    # Loop through each character in the string
    for c in s
        # If the character is not in the set of distinct characters yet,
        # increment the counter and add the character to the set
        if !(c in keys(distinct_characters))
            distinct_char_count += 1
            distinct_characters[c] = true
        end
    end

    return distinct_char_count
end
```

This function works by initializing an empty set `distinct_characters` to keep track of the distinct characters. Then, for each character in the string, it checks if the character is already in the set. If not, it increments the counter and adds the character to the set. Finally, it returns the count of distinct characters.
