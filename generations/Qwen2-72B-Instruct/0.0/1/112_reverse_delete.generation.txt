```julia
function reverse_delete(s::String, c::String)
    # Filter out characters in s that are not in c
    filtered_s = filter(x -> !occursin(x, c), s)
    
    # Check if the filtered string is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = filtered_s == reverse(filtered_s)
    
    return (filtered_s, is_palindrome)
