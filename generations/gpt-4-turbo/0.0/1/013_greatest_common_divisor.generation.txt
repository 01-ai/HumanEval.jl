```julia
function greatest_common_divisor(a::Int, b::Int)::Int
    while b != 0
        a, b = b, a % b
    end
    return abs(a)
end
```

This function implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The algorithm repeatedly replaces the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD. The function also ensures the result is non-negative by taking the absolute value of the result.
