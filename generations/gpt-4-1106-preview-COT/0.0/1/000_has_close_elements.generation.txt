To implement the `has_close_elements` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Sort the list of numbers to ensure that any two close elements are adjacent to each other.
2. Iterate through the sorted list and check the absolute difference between each pair of adjacent elements.
3. If the absolute difference between any pair is less than the given threshold, return `true`.
4. If no such pair is found by the end of the iteration, return `false`.

Now, let's write the code for the function:

```julia
function has_close_elements(numbers::Vector{Float64}, threshold::Float64)::Bool
    # Step 1: Sort the list of numbers
    sorted_numbers = sort(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted list
    for i in 1:length(sorted_numbers)-1
        # Step 3: Check if the absolute difference is less than the threshold
        if abs(sorted_numbers[i] - sorted_numbers[i+1]) < threshold
            return true
        end
    end
    
    # Step 4: Return false if no close elements are found
    return false
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], 0.5)) # Expected output: false
println(has_close_elements([1.0, 2.8, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0], 0.3)) # Expected output: true
```

This function should work correctly according to the specification provided in the doc string.
