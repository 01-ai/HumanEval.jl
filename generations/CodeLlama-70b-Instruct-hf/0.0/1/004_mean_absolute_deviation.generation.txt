```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean_value = mean(numbers)

    # Calculate the absolute differences between each element and the mean
    differences = abs.(numbers .- mean_value)

    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences
    mad = mean(differences)

    return mad
end
```

This function calculates the mean absolute deviation of a given vector of numbers. It first calculates the mean of the input numbers, then calculates the absolute differences between each element and the mean, and finally calculates the mean of the absolute differences.
