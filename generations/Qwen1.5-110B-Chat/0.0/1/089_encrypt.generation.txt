```julia
function encrypt(s::String)
    encrypted = ""
    for c in s
        if c isa Char && 'a' ≤ c ≤ 'z'
            encrypted *= Char(Int(c) + 4)
        elseif c isa Char && 'A' ≤ c ≤ 'Z'
            encrypted *= Char(Int(c) + 4)
        else
            encrypted *= c
        end
    end
    return encrypted
end
```
This function `encrypt` takes a string `s` as input and iterates through each character. If the character is a lowercase or uppercase letter, it adds 4 to its ASCII value to shift it by two multiplied by two places in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. Other characters are added to the encrypted string unchanged.
