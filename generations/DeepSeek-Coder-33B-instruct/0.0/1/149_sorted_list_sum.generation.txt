Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function sorted_list_sum(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths
    xs = filter(x -> iseven(length(x)), xs)

    # Sort the list by length and then alphabetically
    sort(xs, by = x -> (length(x), x))
end
```

This function first filters out the strings with odd lengths using the `filter` function and a lambda function that checks if the length of a string is even. Then it sorts the list by length and then alphabetically using the `sort` function and a tuple of length and string as the sorting key.
