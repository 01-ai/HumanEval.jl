"""
    tri(n::Int)::Vector{Int}

Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in
the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci
sequence. Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:

tri(1) = 1

tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.

tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.

For example:

tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2

tri(4) = 3

tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4) = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6

You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of
the first n numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tri(3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6
```
