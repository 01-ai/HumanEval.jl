Here is the Julia function `rounded_avg` that implements the described functionality:

```julia
function rounded_avg(n::Int, m::Int)::Union{Int, String}
    if n > m
        return -1
    end
    # Calculate the sum of the integers from n to m
    sum_of_integers = sum(n:m)
    # Calculate the count of integers from n to m
    count_of_integers = m - n + 1
    # Calculate the average and round it to the nearest integer
    average = round(Int, sum_of_integers / count_of_integers)
    # Convert the rounded average to binary
    binary_average = string(average, base=2)
    return binary_average
end
```

You can test this function with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.
