```julia
function select_words(s::String, n::Int)::Vector{<:AbstractString}
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    words = split(s)
    selected_words = String[]

    for word in words
        consonant_count = count(c -> c âˆ‰ vowels, word)
        if consonant_count == n
            push!(selected_words, word)
        end
    end

    return selected_words
end
```
This Julia function `select_words` takes a string `s` and an integer `n` as inputs. It splits the string into words, then iterates through each word, counting the number of consonants. If a word has exactly `n` consonants, it adds that word to the `selected_words` array. Finally, it returns the array of selected words.
