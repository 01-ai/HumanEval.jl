```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    sum = 0
    for x in xs
        if x > 0 && isinteger(x) && isodd(x)
            sum += x^2
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This Julia function iterates through the input list, checks if each number is positive, an integer, and odd. If all conditions are met, it squares the number and adds it to the sum. The final sum is returned.
