### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize the total eaten carrots**: Start by setting the total number of eaten carrots to the current number of eaten carrots (`number`).

2. **Calculate the carrots to eat**: Determine how many more carrots the rabbit needs to eat to satisfy its hunger (`need`).

3. **Check carrot availability**: Compare the `need` with the `remaining` carrots to see if there are enough carrots available.

4. **Eat carrots**:
   - If there are enough remaining carrots to satisfy the need, add the `need` to the total eaten carrots and subtract the `need` from the `remaining` carrots.
   - If there are not enough remaining carrots, eat all the remaining carrots. Add the `remaining` carrots to the total eaten carrots and set `remaining` to 0.

5. **Return the result**: Return an array containing the total number of eaten carrots after the meals and the number of carrots left.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function eat(number::Int, need::Int, remaining::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Step 1: Initialize the total eaten carrots
    total_eaten = number
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the carrots to eat (already given as `need`)
    
    # Step 3 & 4: Check carrot availability and eat carrots
    if need <= remaining
        # Enough carrots available
        total_eaten += need
        remaining -= need
    else
        # Not enough carrots, eat all remaining
        total_eaten += remaining
        remaining = 0
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return the result
    return [total_eaten, remaining]
end
```

This function follows the outlined steps to calculate the total number of eaten carrots after the rabbit's meals and the number of carrots left, based on the initial conditions and the rabbit's needs.
