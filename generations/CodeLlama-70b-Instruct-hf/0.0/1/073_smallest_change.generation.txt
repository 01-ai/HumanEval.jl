function smallest_change(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    n = length(xs)
    if n == 0
        return 0
    end

    # Find the middle element(s) of the array
    if n % 2 == 0
        mid = n รท 2
    else
        mid = (n + 1) รท 2
    end

    # Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each element in the first half of the array
    freq = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for i = 1:mid
        freq[xs[i]] = get(freq, xs[i], 0) + 1
    end

    # Initialize the number of changes required
    changes = 0

    # Iterate through the second half of the array
    for i = mid+1:n
        # If the current element is not present in the first half, increase the number of changes
        if !haskey(freq, xs[i])
            changes += 1
        else
            # If the current element is present in the first half, decrease its frequency
            freq[xs[i]] -= 1
            # If the frequency becomes zero, remove the element from the dictionary
            if freq[xs[i]] == 0
                delete!(freq, xs[i])
            end
        end
    end

    return changes
end
```

This function works by finding the middle element(s) of the array and then iterating through the second half of the array. For each element in the second half, it checks if it is present in the first half. If it is not present, it increases the number of changes required. If it is present, it decreases the frequency of the element in the first half. If the frequency becomes zero, it removes the element from the dictionary.
