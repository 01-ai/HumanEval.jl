function sum_squares(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    sum = 0
    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        if i % 3 == 0
            sum += x^2
        elseif i % 4 == 0 && i % 3 != 0
            sum += x^3
        else
            sum += x
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates through the list and checks if the index is a multiple of 3, 4, or neither. If the index is a multiple of 3, it squares the entry. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, it cubes the entry. If the index is neither a multiple of 3 nor 4, it leaves the entry unchanged. It then adds the entry to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum of all entries.
