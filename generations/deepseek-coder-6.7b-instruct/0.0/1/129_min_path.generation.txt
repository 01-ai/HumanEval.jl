Here is a Julia function that solves the problem using dynamic programming. The function first initializes a 3D array dp to store the minimum path for each cell and each length. Then it iterates over the grid and for each cell, it iterates over the possible lengths from 1 to k. For each length, it iterates over the possible previous cells and updates the dp array accordingly. Finally, it returns the minimum path of length k.

```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = length(grid)
    dp = fill((typemax(Int), Vector{Int}()), N, N, k)

    for i in 1:N
        for j in 1:N
            dp[i, j, 1] = (grid[i][j], [grid[i][j]])
        end
    end

    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
    for len in 2:k
        for i in 1:N
            for j in 1:N
                for (dx, dy) in directions
                    x, y = i + dx, j + dy
                    if 1 <= x <= N && 1 <= y <= N
                        (min_val, min_path) = dp[x, y, len-1]
                        if grid[i][j] < min_val
                            dp[i, j, len] = (grid[i][j], [grid[i][j]; min_path])
                        elseif grid[i][j] == min_val
                            dp[i, j, len] = (min_val, min_path)
                        end
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end

    min_val, min_path = findmin(dp[:, :, k])
    return min_path
end
```

This function assumes that the grid is a square grid and that the cells are numbered from 1 to N*N in row-major order. The function also assumes that the grid is large enough to contain a path of length k.
