### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize a counter**: This will keep track of the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

2. **Iterate through the array**: Since a palindromic array is symmetric, we only need to iterate through the first half of the array. For each element in the first half, compare it with the corresponding element in the second half (i.e., the element at the same distance from the end of the array).

3. **Compare elements**: For each pair of elements (one from the start half and one from the end half), check if they are equal. If they are not equal, increment the counter by 1. This increment represents the need to change one of these elements to make them equal, contributing to the palindromic structure.

4. **Return the counter**: After iterating through the first half of the array and making the necessary comparisons, return the counter. This value represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function smallest_change(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Step 1: Initialize the counter
    changes_needed = 0
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the first half of the array
    for i in 1:div(length(xs), 2)
        # Step 3: Compare elements from the start and end halves
        if xs[i] != xs[end - i + 1]
            # If they are not equal, increment the counter
            changes_needed += 1
        end
    end
    
    # Step 4: Return the counter
    return changes_needed
end
```

This function efficiently calculates the minimum number of changes needed to make an array palindromic by leveraging the symmetry of palindromic structures. It iterates only through half of the array, minimizing the number of comparisons and changes calculated.
