```

This function first checks if the file name contains more than three digits. If it does, it returns "No". Then, it checks if the file name contains exactly one dot. If it doesn't, it returns "No".

Next, it splits the file name into two parts using the dot as a separator. It checks if the first part is empty or starts with a letter. If it is, it returns "No".

Finally, it checks if the second part is one of "txt", "exe", or "dll". If it isn't, it returns "No". If all conditions are met, it returns "Yes".
