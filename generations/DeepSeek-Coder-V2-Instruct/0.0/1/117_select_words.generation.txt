 Here's the implementation of the `select_words` function in Julia:

```julia
function select_words(s::String, n::Int)::Vector{<:AbstractString}
    # Define vowels for easy checking
    vowels = Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'])
    
    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)
    
    # Function to count consonants in a word
    function count_consonants(word::AbstractString)
        count = 0
        for char in word
            if char âˆ‰ vowels && isletter(char)
                count += 1
            end
        end
        return count
    end
    
    # Filter words that have exactly `n` consonants
    result = [word for word in words if count_consonants(word) == n]
    
    return result
end
```

This function works as follows:
1. It defines a set of vowels for easy checking.
2. It splits the input string `s` into words.
3. It defines a helper function `count_consonants` to count the number of consonants in a word.
4. It filters the words to find those that have exactly `n` consonants and returns them.

You can test this function with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly.
