Certainly! Below is the Julia function `filter_by_prefix` that filters a list of strings based on the given prefix:

```julia
function filter_by_prefix(xs::Vector{String}, prefix::String)::Vector{String}
    # Use the `startswith` function to filter strings that start with the given prefix
    return filter(x -> startswith(x, prefix), xs)
end

# Examples
println(filter_by_prefix(String[], "a")) # Should print an empty array
println(filter_by_prefix(["abc", "bcd", "cde", "array"], "a")) # Should print ["abc", "array"]
```

You can copy this function into your Julia environment and use it as described in the docstring. The `filter` function is used with an anonymous function that checks if each string in the list starts with the specified prefix using the `startswith` function.
