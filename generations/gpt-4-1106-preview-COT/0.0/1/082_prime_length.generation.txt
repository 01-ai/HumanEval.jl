To implement the `prime_length` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `prime_length` that takes a string `s` as input.
2. Calculate the length of the string `s`.
3. Check if the length of the string is a prime number.
    - To do this, we will create a helper function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` and returns `true` if `n` is a prime number, and `false` otherwise.
    - In the `is_prime` function, we will check for the following conditions:
        - If `n` is less than 2, it is not a prime number.
        - If `n` is 2, it is a prime number.
        - If `n` is even and greater than 2, it is not a prime number.
        - For all other `n`, we will check if there are any divisors other than 1 and `n` itself. We only need to check up to the square root of `n` because a larger factor would have a corresponding smaller factor that would have been found already.
4. Return `true` if the length is a prime number, or `false` otherwise.

Now, let's write the code for the `prime_length` function and the `is_prime` helper function.
