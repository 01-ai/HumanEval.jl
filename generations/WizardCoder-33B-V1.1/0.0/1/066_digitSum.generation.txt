Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function digitSum(s::String)::Int
    sum = 0
    for c in s
        if isuppercase(c)
            sum += Int(c)
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the string. If the character is an uppercase letter (checked using the `isuppercase` function), it adds the ASCII code of the character to the sum. The function finally returns the sum.
