  Here's an implementation of the `choose_num` function in Julia:
```
function choose_num(x::Int, y::Int)::Int
    if x > y
        return -1
    end
    for i in x:y
        if i % 2 == 0
            return i
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```
This function first checks if `x` is greater than `y`, in which case it returns `-1` since there is no even number in the range `[x, y]`. Otherwise, it iterates over the range `[x, y]` and returns the first even number it finds. If no even number is found, it returns `-1`.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
julia> choose_num(12, 15)
14

julia> choose_num(13, 12)
-1
```
