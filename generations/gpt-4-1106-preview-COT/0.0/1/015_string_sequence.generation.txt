To implement the `string_sequence` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Check if `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is negative, we should return an appropriate error message or handle it as per the requirements.
2. Initialize an empty string to accumulate the sequence.
3. Loop from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and for each number:
   a. Convert the number to a string.
   b. Append the string representation of the number to the accumulator string, followed by a space.
4. Trim the trailing space from the accumulator string to ensure the format is correct.
5. Return the accumulator string.

Now, let's write the code for the `string_sequence` function:

```julia
function string_sequence(n::Int)::String
    # Step 1: Check if `n` is non-negative
    if n < 0
        throw(ArgumentError("n must be a non-negative integer"))
    end

    # Step 2: Initialize an empty string
    sequence_str = ""

    # Step 3: Loop from 0 to `n` and build the sequence string
    for i in 0:n
        sequence_str *= "$i "
    end

    # Step 4: Trim the trailing space
    sequence_str = chop(sequence_str)

    # Step 5: Return the sequence string
    return sequence_str
end
```

This function will generate a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive, as required.
