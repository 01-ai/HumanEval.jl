Here is the Julia function that implements the functionality described in the doc string:

```julia
function find_closest_elements(numbers::Vector{Float64})
    # Sort the numbers to make comparison easier
    sorted_numbers = sort(numbers)
    # Initialize variables to store the closest pair and their difference
    closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[1], sorted_numbers[2])
    smallest_diff = abs(sorted_numbers[2] - sorted_numbers[1])
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the pair with the smallest difference
    for i in 1:(length(sorted_numbers) - 1)
        diff = abs(sorted_numbers[i+1] - sorted_numbers[i])
        if diff < smallest_diff
            smallest_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (sorted_numbers[i], sorted_numbers[i+1])
        end
    end
    
    return closest_pair
end
```

This function first sorts the input vector to ensure that all potential pairs are adjacent to each other, which simplifies the process of finding the closest pair. It then iterates through the sorted list, comparing each pair of adjacent numbers to find the pair with the smallest difference. The function finally returns this closest pair.
