Sure, here is the Julia function that fulfills the requirements:

```julia
function below_threshold(l::Vector, t::Number)::Bool
    for i in l
        if i >= t
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```
This function iterates over each element in the vector `l` and checks if it is greater than or equal to the threshold `t`. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns `false`. If it doesn't find any element greater than or equal to `t` after checking all elements, it returns `true`.
