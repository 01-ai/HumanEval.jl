```julia
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # Replace all spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")

    # Replace consecutive spaces with -
    while occursin("__", s)
        s = replace(s, "__" => "-")
    end

    return s
end
```

This function first replaces all spaces with underscores, and then it replaces consecutive underscores with a single hyphen.
