Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    sentences = split(s, r"[.?!]")
    count = 0
    for sentence in sentences
        if startswith(sentence, "I")
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into sentences using the `split` function. It then iterates over each sentence and checks if it starts with the word "I". If it does, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns the counter, which represents the number of boredoms.
