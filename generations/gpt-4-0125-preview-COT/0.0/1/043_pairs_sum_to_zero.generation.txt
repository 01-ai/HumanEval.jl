### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize a Set**: Create an empty set to keep track of the elements we've seen so far. This will help us check in constant time whether there exists an element in the list that can be paired with the current element to sum to zero.

2. **Iterate Through the List**: Loop through each element in the input list.

    a. **Check for Complement**: For each element, calculate its complement (i.e., the value that, when added to it, equals zero). This is simply the negative of the current element.
    
    b. **Check if Complement Exists**: Check if the complement of the current element exists in the set. If it does, return `true` because we've found a pair that sums to zero.
    
    c. **Add Current Element to Set**: If the complement is not found, add the current element to the set and continue to the next element.

3. **Return False**: If the loop completes without finding any such pair, return `false`.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function pairs_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # Step 1: Initialize a Set
    seen = Set{Int}()
    
    # Step 2: Iterate Through the List
    for num in l
        # Step 2a: Check for Complement
        complement = -num
        
        # Step 2b: Check if Complement Exists
        if complement in seen
            return true
        end
        
        # Step 2c: Add Current Element to Set
        push!(seen, num)
    end
    
    # Step 3: Return False
    return false
end
```

This implementation efficiently checks for the existence of a pair that sums to zero by leveraging a set for constant-time lookups. It avoids unnecessary comparisons and directly checks for the complement of each element, ensuring an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.
