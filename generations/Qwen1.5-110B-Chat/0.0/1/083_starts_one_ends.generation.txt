```julia
function starts_one_ends(n::Int)::Int
    if n == 1
        return 2
    end
    # Numbers starting with 1: 10^(n-1) possibilities
    # Numbers ending with 1: 9 * 10^(n-2) possibilities (excluding numbers starting with 1)
    # Subtract the overlap (numbers starting and ending with 1: 10^(n-2) possibilities)
    count = 10^(n-1) + 9 * 10^(n-2) - 10^(n-2)
    return count
end
```
This function calculates the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, correctly handling the cases and avoiding double-counting numbers that both start and end with 1.
