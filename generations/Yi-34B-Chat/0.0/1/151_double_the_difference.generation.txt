```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    # Initialize the result to 0
    result = 0

    # Loop through the list, adding the square of each odd number to the result
    for x in xs
        if x > 0 && x % 2 == 1  # Check if x is positive and odd
            result += x^2  # Add the square of x to the result
        end
    end

    # Return the result
    return result
