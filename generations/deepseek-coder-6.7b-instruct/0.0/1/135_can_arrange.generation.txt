Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    for i in length(xs):-1:2
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            return i-1
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```

This function iterates over the array in reverse order, starting from the end. It checks each pair of elements, if the current element is less than the previous one, it returns the index of the previous element. If no such pair is found after checking all elements, it returns -1.
