To implement the `right_angle_triangle` function in Julia, we'll use the Pythagorean theorem. In a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.

Here's the implementation:

```julia
function right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool
    sides = sort([a, b, c])
    return isapprox(sides[1]^2 + sides[2]^2, sides[3]^2, rtol=1e-9)
end
```

Let's break down this implementation:

1. We use the `sort` function to arrange the sides in ascending order. This ensures that the largest side (the potential hypotenuse) is always at the end.

2. We check if the sum of squares of the two shorter sides is approximately equal to the square of the longest side using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. We use `isapprox` instead of exact equality to account for potential floating-point inaccuracies. The `rtol` parameter sets a relative tolerance of 1e-9, which should be suitable for most practical cases.

4. The function returns `true` if the condition is met (indicating a right-angled triangle) and `false` otherwise.

This implementation will work for both integer and floating-point inputs. It correctly handles cases where the right angle might not be between the two shortest sides.

You can use this function as shown in the examples:

```julia
julia> right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)
true

julia> right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)
false
```

The function will also work correctly for floating-point inputs and for triangles where the right angle is not between the two shortest sides:

```julia
julia> right_angle_triangle(5.0, 12.0, 13.0)
true

julia> right_angle_triangle(12, 5, 13)
true
```

This implementation should cover all cases and provide accurate results for determining whether a triangle is right-angled based on its side lengths.
