```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Extract elements at indices divisible by 3
    div3_elements = l[3:3:end]
    # Sort these elements
    sorted_div3 = sort(div3_elements)
    # Create a copy of the original list to modify
    l_prime = copy(l)
    # Replace elements at indices divisible by 3 with sorted elements
    for i in 1:length(sorted_div3)
        l_prime[3i] = sorted_div3[i]
    end
    return l_prime
end
```

This function first extracts the elements at indices divisible by 3 from the input list `l`. It then sorts these elements and creates a copy of the original list to modify. The function then replaces the elements at indices divisible by 3 in the copy with the sorted elements, and finally returns the modified copy.
