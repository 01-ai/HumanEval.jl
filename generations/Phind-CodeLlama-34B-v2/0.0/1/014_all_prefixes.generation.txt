Here is the Julia function that implements the `all_prefixes` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function all_prefixes(s::String)::Vector{String}
    return [s[1:i] for i in 1:length(s)]
end
```

This function uses a list comprehension to generate all prefixes of the input string `s`. The list comprehension iterates over the range `1:length(s)`, and for each `i` in this range, it extracts the substring of `s` from the start of the string to the `i`-th character (inclusive) and adds this substring to the output list. As the range goes from the smallest to the largest value, the substrings are returned in order of increasing length, from the shortest prefix (the first character of the string) to the longest prefix (the whole string).
