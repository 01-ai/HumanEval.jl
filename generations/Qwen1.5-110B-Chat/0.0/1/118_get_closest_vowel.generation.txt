```julia
function get_closest_vowel(word::String)::String
    vowels = "AEIOUaeiou"
    consonants = "BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZbcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"
    closest_vowel = ""

    for i in (length(word)-1):-1:1
        if word[i] in vowels && isin(word[i-1], consonants) && isin(word[i+1], consonants)
            closest_vowel = word[i]
            break
        end
    end

    return closest_vowel
end
```
This Julia function iterates through the given word from right to left, checking for a vowel that is surrounded by consonants. When it finds such a vowel, it saves it and stops searching. If no such vowel is found, it returns an empty string.
