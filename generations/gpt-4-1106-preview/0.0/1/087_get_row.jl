    get_row(xs::Vector{Vector{Int}}, x::Int)::Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}}

You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists, which is similar to
matrix, however, unlike matrices, each row may contain a different number of
columns. Given `xs`, and integer `x`, find integers `x` in the list `xs`, and
return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that each tuple is a
coordinate - (row, columns), starting with `1`. Sort coordinates initially by
rows in ascending order. Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in
descending order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> get_row([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]], 1)
5-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64}}:
 (1, 1)
 (2, 5)
 (2, 1)
 (3, 6)
 (3, 1)

julia> get_row(Vector{Int}[], 1)
Tuple{Int64, Int64}[]

julia> get_row(Vector{Int}[Int[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3)
1-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64}}:
 (3, 3)
```
