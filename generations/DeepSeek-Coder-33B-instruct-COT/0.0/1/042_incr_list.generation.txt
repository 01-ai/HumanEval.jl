Here is the Julia function based on the given doc string:

```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    return xs .+ 1
end
```

This function takes a vector `xs` as input and returns a new vector where each element is incremented by 1. The `.+` operator is used to perform element-wise addition.

Here is how you can test the function:

```julia
julia> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 4

julia> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
9-element Vector{Int64}:
   6
   4
   6
   3
   4
   4
  10
   1
 124
```
