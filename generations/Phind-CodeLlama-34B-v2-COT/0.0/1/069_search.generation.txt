To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer in the list.
2. Iterate over the dictionary, and for each integer `i`, check if its frequency is greater than or equal to `i` itself.
3. If such an integer is found, return it.
4. If no such integer is found after iterating over the entire dictionary, return -1.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above steps:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each integer
    freq = Dict{Int, Int}()

    # Iterate over the list and update the frequency of each integer
    for num in numbers
        if haskey(freq, num)
            freq[num] += 1
        else
            freq[num] = 1
        end
    end

    # Iterate over the dictionary and return the first integer that satisfies the condition
    for (i, f) in freq
        if f >= i
            return i
        end
    end

    # If no such integer is found, return -1
    return -1
end
```

This function works by first creating a frequency dictionary of the input list, then iterating over the dictionary to find the first integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to itself. If no such integer is found, it returns -1.
