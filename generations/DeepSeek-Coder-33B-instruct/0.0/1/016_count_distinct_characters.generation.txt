Here is a Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    return length(Set(lowercase(s)))
end
```

This function works by first converting the string to lowercase using the `lowercase` function, then converting the string to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate characters. The number of elements in the set is then returned, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.

Here is how you can test the function:

```julia
println(count_distinct_characters("xyzXYZ"))  # Output: 3
println(count_distinct_characters("Jerry"))  # Output: 4
```
