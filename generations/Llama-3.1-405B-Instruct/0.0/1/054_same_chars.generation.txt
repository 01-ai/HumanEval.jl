Here is a Julia function that implements the `same_chars` function as described in the docstring:
```julia
function same_chars(s0::String, s1::String)::Bool
    # Convert both strings to sets of characters
    set0 = Set(collect(s0))
    set1 = Set(collect(s1))
    
    # Check if the two sets are equal
    return set0 == set1
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We convert each string to a set of characters using the `collect` function, which returns a vector of characters, and then the `Set` constructor, which removes duplicates and returns a set of unique characters.
2. We then compare the two sets using the `==` operator, which returns `true` if the two sets are equal and `false` otherwise.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the shorter string, since we need to iterate over each character in the strings to create the sets.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring:
```julia
println(same_chars("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc"))  # true
println(same_chars("abcd", "dddddddabc"))  # true
println(same_chars("dddddddabc", "abcd"))  # true
println(same_chars("eabcd", "dddddddabc"))  # false
println(same_chars("abcd", "dddddddabce"))  # false
println(same_chars("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddddabc"))  # false
```
