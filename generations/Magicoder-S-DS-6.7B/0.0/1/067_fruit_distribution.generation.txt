Here is a Julia function that implements the `fruit_distribution` function as described in the problem:

```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)

    # Extract the number of apples and oranges
    apples = parse(Int, words[1])
    oranges = parse(Int, words[4])

    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges

    return mangoes
end
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into words. It then extracts the number of apples and oranges from the string and calculates the number of mangoes by subtracting the total number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits. The result is then returned.
