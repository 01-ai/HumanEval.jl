Here is a Julia function that implements the given problem:

```julia
function strongest_extension(class_name::String, extensions::Vector{String})::String
    strongest_extension = extensions[1]
    max_strength = -Inf
    for extension in extensions
        strength = count(isuppercase, extension) - count(islowercase, extension)
        if strength > max_strength
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension
        end
    end
    return "$class_name.$strongest_extension"
end
```

This function iterates over the list of extensions, calculates the strength of each extension, and keeps track of the strongest extension found so far. If it finds an extension with a higher strength, it updates the strongest extension and its strength. Finally, it returns the class name and the strongest extension in the required format.
