Here is a step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
2. Iterate over each character in the string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket "(", increment the counter.
4. If the character is a closing bracket ")", decrement the counter.
5. If the counter goes below 0 at any point, return false.
6. After the loop, if the counter is not 0, return false.
7. Otherwise, return true.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above steps:

```julia
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    counter = 0
    for bracket in brackets
        if bracket == '('
            counter += 1
        elseif bracket == ')'
            counter -= 1
        end
        if counter < 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return counter == 0
end
```

This function works by keeping track of the number of unmatched opening brackets. If it ever goes below 0, it means there is a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so it returns false. If it finishes the loop and the counter is not 0, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
