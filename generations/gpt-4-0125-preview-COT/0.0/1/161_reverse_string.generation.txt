### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Check for Letters**: Determine if the string contains any letters. This can be done by iterating through the string and checking if any character is a letter using the `isletter` function.

2. **Reverse Case or String**:
   - If the string contains letters, iterate through each character of the string. For each character, check if it is a letter.
     - If it is a letter, reverse its case. This can be done by checking if the letter is uppercase or lowercase using `isupper` or `islower` functions, then converting it to the opposite case using `uppercase` or `lowercase` functions.
     - If it is not a letter, keep it as it is.
   - If the string does not contain any letters, reverse the string. This can be done using the `reverse` function.

3. **Return Result**: Return the modified string as the result.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function reverse_string(s::String)::String
    # Step 1: Check for letters
    contains_letters = any(isletter, s)
    
    # Step 2: Reverse case or string
    if contains_letters
        # Reverse case for letters, keep others as is
        return join([isletter(c) ? (islower(c) ? uppercase(c) : lowercase(c)) : c for c in s])
    else
        # Reverse the string if no letters are present
        return reverse(s)
    end
end

# Examples
println(reverse_string("1234"))  # Expected: "4321"
println(reverse_string("ab"))    # Expected: "AB"
println(reverse_string("#a@C"))  # Expected: "#A@c"
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps, first checking for the presence of letters, then either reversing the case of letters or reversing the entire string based on that check, and finally returning the modified string.
