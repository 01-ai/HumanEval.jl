```julia
function encrypt(s::String)
    # Define the shift amount
    shift = 2 * 2  # As specified, shift down by two multiplied by two places

    # Encrypt the string by shifting each character
    encrypted = [char(c + shift) for c in s]

    # Convert the list of characters back to a string
    return join(encrypted)
end

# Helper function to handle character wrapping for lowercase letters
function char(c::Int)
    # Check if the character is a lowercase letter
    if 'a' <= c <= 'z'
        # Wrap around if the shift goes beyond 'z'
        return Char((c - 'a' + 26) % 26 + 'a')
    else
        # Return the character as is if it's not a lowercase letter
        return Char(c)
    end
end
```

This implementation of the `encrypt` function shifts each character in the input string by 4 positions down the alphabet. The `char` helper function ensures that the shift wraps around correctly if it goes beyond 'z'. Characters that are not lowercase letters are returned unchanged.
