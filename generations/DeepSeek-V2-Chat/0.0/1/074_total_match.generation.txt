Here's the implementation of the `total_match` function in Julia:

```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Calculate the total number of characters in each list
    total_chars_xs = sum(length(s) for s in xs)
    total_chars_ys = sum(length(s) for s in ys)
    
    # Compare the total number of characters and return the appropriate list
    if total_chars_xs <= total_chars_ys
        return xs
    else
        return ys
    end
end
```

This function calculates the total number of characters in each list of strings and returns the list with the fewer total characters. If both lists have the same number of characters, it returns the first list.
