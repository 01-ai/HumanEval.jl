```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Calculate the total number of characters in each list
    total_xs = sum(length, xs)
    total_ys = sum(length, ys)

    # If the total number of characters in xs is less than ys, return xs
    if total_xs < total_ys
        return xs
    end

    # If the total number of characters in ys is less than xs, return ys
    if total_ys < total_xs
        return ys
    end

    # If the total number of characters in xs and ys are equal, return the first list
    return xs
end
```

This function calculates the total number of characters in each list and returns the list with the fewer number of characters. If the total number of characters in both lists are equal, it returns the first list.
