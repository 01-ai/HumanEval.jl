Here is a simple Julia function that matches the provided docstring:
```julia
"""
    sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int

`sum_to_n` is a function that sums numbers from `1` to `n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum_to_n(30)
465

julia> sum_to_n(100)
5050

julia> sum_to_n(5)
15

julia> sum_to_n(10)
55

julia> sum_to_n(1)
1
```
"""
function sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int
    return sum(1:n)
end
```
This function uses Julia's built-in `sum` function and range operator `:`, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`. The `sum` function then adds up all the numbers in this sequence, returning the result.

Alternatively, you could use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. Here's an implementation using this formula:
```julia
function sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int
    return n * (n + 1) รท 2
end
```
This implementation is likely to be faster and more efficient for large values of `n`, since it avoids generating a sequence of numbers and instead uses a simple mathematical formula.
