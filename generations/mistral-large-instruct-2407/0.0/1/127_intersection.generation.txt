 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `intersection` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    intersection(interval1::Vector{Int}, interval2::Vector{Int})::String

You are given two intervals, where each interval is a pair of integers. For
example, interval = (start, end) = (1, 2). The given intervals are closed which
means that the interval (start, end) includes both start and end. For each given
interval, it is assumed that its start is less or equal its end. Your task is to
determine whether the length of intersection of these two intervals is a prime
number. Example, the intersection of the intervals (1, 3), (2, 4) is (2, 3)
which its length is 1, which not a prime number. If the length of the
intersection is a prime number, return "YES", otherwise, return "NO". If the two
intervals don't intersect, return "NO".

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> intersection([1, 2], [2, 3])
"NO"

julia> intersection([-1, 1], [0, 4])
"NO"

julia> intersection([-3, -1], [-5, 5])
"YES"
```
"""
function intersection(interval1::Vector{Int}, interval2::Vector{Int})::String
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2

    # Find the intersection
    intersect_start = max(start1, start2)
    intersect_end = min(end1, end2)

    # Check if there is an intersection
    if intersect_start <= intersect_end
        # Calculate the length of the intersection
        length_intersection = intersect_end - intersect_start + 1

        # Check if the length is a prime number
        if isprime(length_intersection)
            return "YES"
        end
    end

    return "NO"
end

# Helper function to check if a number is prime
function isprime(n::Int)::Bool
    if n <= 1
        return false
    end
    if n <= 3
        return true
    end
    if n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0
        return false
    end
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n
        if n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0
            return false
        end
        i += 6
    end
    return true
end
```

This implementation includes the `intersection` function that calculates the intersection of two intervals and checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number. The `isprime` helper function is used to determine if a number is prime. The function returns "YES" if the length of the intersection is a prime number, and "NO" otherwise.
