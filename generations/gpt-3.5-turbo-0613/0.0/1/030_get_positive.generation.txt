Here is the implementation of the `get_positive` function in Julia:

```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector)
    return filter(x -> x > 0, xs)
end
```

This function takes a vector `xs` as input and uses the `filter` function to return a new vector containing only the positive numbers from the input vector.
