Here is the Julia function `triples_sum_to_zero` that implements the functionality described in the doc string:

```julia
function triples_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    n = length(l)
    # If there are fewer than 3 elements, we cannot have a triple that sums to zero.
    if n < 3
        return false
    end

    # Sort the array to use two-pointer technique
    sort!(l)

    for i in 1:n-2
        # To avoid duplicates, skip the same value as the previous one
        if i > 1 && l[i] == l[i-1]
            continue
        end

        # Initialize two pointers
        left = i + 1
        right = n

        while left < right
            current_sum = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]

            if current_sum == 0
                # Found a triple that sums to zero
                return true
            elseif current_sum < 0
                # Move the left pointer to the right
                left += 1
            else
                # Move the right pointer to the left
                right -= 1
            end
        end
    end

    # No triple found that sums to zero
    return false
end
```

This function first checks if the list has fewer than three elements, in which case it immediately returns `false`. It then sorts the list to use the two-pointer technique effectively. The function iterates through the list, using a fixed element and two pointers to find a triple that sums to zero. If such a triple is found, it returns `true`; otherwise, it continues searching. If no such triple is found by the end of the function, it returns `false`.
