```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the object is balanced
    is_balanced = q == reverse(q)

    # Check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight
    sum_elements = sum(q)
    is_weight_ok = sum_elements <= w

    # Return true if both conditions are met, otherwise return false
    return is_balanced && is_weight_ok
end
```

This function first checks if the object `q` is balanced by comparing it with its reverse. If it is balanced, it then checks if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. If both conditions are met, it returns `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.
