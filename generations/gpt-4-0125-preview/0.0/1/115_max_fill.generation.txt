To implement the `max_fill` function as described, we need to calculate the total number of times buckets need to be lowered into the wells to extract all the water, given the capacity of the buckets. Here's how we can do it in Julia:

```julia
function max_fill(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, capacity::Int)::Int
    # Calculate the total amount of water in all wells
    total_water = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    
    # Calculate the number of times buckets need to be lowered
    # This is the total water divided by the capacity of the buckets
    # If there is a remainder, it means an additional lowering is needed
    bucket_lowers = div(total_water, capacity)
    if total_water % capacity != 0
        bucket_lowers += 1
    end
    
    return bucket_lowers
end
```

This function works by first calculating the total amount of water present in all the wells. It then divides this total by the capacity of the buckets to find out how many times the buckets need to be lowered. If there's a remainder after this division, it means that an additional lowering of the bucket is necessary to extract the remaining water, hence the conditional increment of `bucket_lowers`.
