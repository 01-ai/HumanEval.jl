### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize a Counter**: Start with a variable to keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears.

2. **Iterate Through Numbers Less Than `n`**: Use a loop to go through each number starting from 1 up to `n-1`.

3. **Check Divisibility**: For each number, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, proceed to the next step; otherwise, continue to the next iteration.

4. **Count Digit 7**: If a number is divisible by 11 or 13, convert it to a string and count the occurrences of the digit '7'. Add this count to the counter initialized in step 1.

5. **Return the Counter**: After iterating through all numbers less than `n`, return the counter value.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function fizz_buzz(n::Int)
    # Step 1: Initialize a counter
    count_sevens = 0

    # Step 2: Iterate through numbers less than `n`
    for i in 1:n-1
        # Step 3: Check divisibility by 11 or 13
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0
            # Step 4: Count digit 7 in the number
            count_sevens += count('7', string(i))
        end
    end

    # Step 5: Return the counter
    return count_sevens
end
```

This function follows the outlined steps to count the occurrences of the digit 7 in numbers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13, and returns the total count.
