To implement the `encode_shift` function in Julia, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each character in the input string `s`.
2. For each character, subtract the ASCII value of 'a' to get the position of the character in the alphabet (0-25).
3. Add 5 to the position to shift the character by 5 in the alphabet.
4. Use modulo 26 to handle the case where the shifted position is greater than 25.
5. Add the ASCII value of 'a' back to the shifted position to get the ASCII value of the shifted character.
6. Join all the shifted characters into a string and return it.

Here is the Julia code for the `encode_shift` function:

```julia
function encode_shift(s::String)::String
    join(((x - 'a' + 5 + 26) % 26 + 'a' for x in s))
end
```

This function uses a generator expression to create a sequence of shifted characters. The generator expression `(x - 'a' + 5 + 26) % 26 + 'a' for x in s` generates a new character for each character `x` in the input string `s`. The `join` function then concatenates all the generated characters into a single string.

To decode a string that has been encoded with this function, you can use the same function with a shift of -5 instead of 5:

```julia
function decode_shift(s::String)::String
    join(((x - 'a' - 5 + 26) % 26 + 'a' for x in s))
end
```

This function performs the same operations as `encode_shift`, but with a shift of -5 to shift the characters back to their original positions in the alphabet.
