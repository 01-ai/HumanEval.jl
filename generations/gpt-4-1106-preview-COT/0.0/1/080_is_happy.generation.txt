### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Check if the length of the string `s` is less than 3. If it is, return `false` because the string cannot be happy according to the definition.
2. Iterate through the string from the first character to the third-to-last character (inclusive).
3. For each character at index `i`, check if the character at `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2` are all distinct.
4. If any set of three consecutive characters are not distinct, return `false`.
5. If the loop completes without finding any set of three identical consecutive characters, return `true`.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function is_happy(s::String)::Bool
    # Step 1: Check if the string is too short to be happy
    if length(s) < 3
        return false
    end
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the string
    for i in 1:(length(s) - 2)
        # Step 3: Check if three consecutive characters are distinct
        if s[i] == s[i+1] || s[i+1] == s[i+2] || s[i] == s[i+2]
            # Step 4: If not, the string is not happy
            return false
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: If the loop completes, the string is happy
    return true
end
```

This function will return `true` if the string is happy according to the given definition, and `false` otherwise.
