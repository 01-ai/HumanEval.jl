 To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. This approach will allow us to explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from any cell in the grid. We will keep track of the paths and compare them lexicographically to find the minimum path.

Here's the implementation of the `min_path` function in Julia:

```julia
using DataStructures

function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = length(grid)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

    function is_valid(x, y)
        return 1 <= x <= N && 1 <= y <= N
    end

    function bfs(start_x, start_y)
        queue = Queue{Tuple{Int, Int, Vector{Int}}}()
        enqueue!(queue, (start_x, start_y, [grid[start_x][start_y]]))

        while !isempty(queue)
            x, y, path = dequeue!(queue)

            if length(path) == k
                return path
            end

            for dir in directions
                new_x, new_y = x + dir[1], y + dir[2]
                if is_valid(new_x, new_y)
                    new_path = copy(path)
                    push!(new_path, grid[new_x][new_y])
                    enqueue!(queue, (new_x, new_y, new_path))
                end
            end
        end

        return []
    end

    min_path = []
    for i in 1:N
        for j in 1:N
            path = bfs(i, j)
            if isempty(min_path) || path < min_path
                min_path = path
            end
        end
    end

    return min_path
end

# Examples
println(min_path([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3))
println(min_path([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We define the size of the grid `N`.
   - We define the possible directions to move in the grid (up, down, left, right).

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - `is_valid(x, y)`: Checks if the coordinates `(x, y)` are within the grid boundaries.
   - `bfs(start_x, start_y)`: Performs a BFS starting from the cell `(start_x, start_y)` to find a path of length `k`.

3. **BFS Implementation**:
   - We use a queue to store the current cell and the path taken to reach that cell.
   - We dequeue the front of the queue, check if the path length is `k`, and if so, return the path.
   - For each valid neighboring cell, we enqueue the new cell and the updated path.

4. **Finding the Minimum Path**:
   - We iterate over all cells in the grid and perform BFS from each cell.
   - We compare the paths lexicographically and keep track of the minimum path found.

5. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we return the minimum path found.

This implementation ensures that we explore all possible paths of length `k` and find the lexicographically smallest one.
