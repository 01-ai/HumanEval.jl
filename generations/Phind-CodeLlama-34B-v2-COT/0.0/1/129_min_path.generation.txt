To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We start from every cell, and then we move to its neighbor cells. We keep track of the path length and the path itself. If we find a path of length `k`, we compare it with the current minimum path. If it's smaller, we update the minimum path.

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize a queue with all cells and their coordinates.
2. Initialize a variable `min_path` with a large number and a variable `min_path_length` with `N * N + 1`.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   a. Dequeue a cell and its coordinates.
   b. If the cell's value is smaller than the current minimum path's first value, continue to the next cell.
   c. If the cell's value is equal to the current minimum path's first value and the path length is `k`, return the current minimum path.
   d. If the cell's value is equal to the current minimum path's first value and the path length is less than `k`, enqueue the neighbor cells and their coordinates.
   e. If the cell's value is larger than the current minimum path's first value and the path length is less than `k`, enqueue the neighbor cells and their coordinates.
4. Return the minimum path.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = length(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right, down, left, up
    visited = fill(false, N, N)
    min_path = fill(0, k)
    min_path_length = N * N + 1

    function bfs(row, col, path, path_length)
        if path_length == k
            if path < min_path
                min_path = path
                min_path_length = k
            end
            return
        end

        for (dr, dc) in directions
            nr, nc = row + dr, col + dc
            if 1 <= nr <= N && 1 <= nc <= N && !visited[nr, nc]
                visited[nr, nc] = true
                new_path = [path; grid[nr, nc]]
                bfs(nr, nc, new_path, path_length + 1)
                visited[nr, nc] = false
            end
        end
    end

    for i in 1:N, j in 1:N
        visited[i, j] = true
        bfs(i, j, [grid[i, j]], 1)
        visited[i, j] = false
    end

    return min_path[1:min_path_length]
end
```

This function first initializes the `visited` matrix and the `min_path` and `min_path_length` variables. Then it defines a helper function `bfs` that performs the BFS. Finally, it iterates over all cells and starts the BFS from each cell.
