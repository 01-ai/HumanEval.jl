Here is a step-by-step outline of how to solve this problem:

1. Create a dictionary that maps the string representation of numbers to their integer values.
2. Split the input string into a list of words.
3. Map the list of words to their corresponding integer values using the dictionary.
4. Sort the list of integers.
5. Map the sorted list of integers back to their corresponding string values using the dictionary.
6. Join the list of string values into a single string with spaces between each word.

Here is the Julia code that implements this algorithm:

```julia
function sort_numbers(numbers::String)::String
    # Create a dictionary that maps the string representation of numbers to their integer values
    num_dict = Dict("zero" => 0, "one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3, "four" => 4, "five" => 5, "six" => 6, "seven" => 7, "eight" => 8, "nine" => 9)

    # Split the input string into a list of words
    words = split(numbers)

    # Map the list of words to their corresponding integer values using the dictionary
    nums = map(word -> num_dict[word], words)

    # Sort the list of integers
    sorted_nums = sort(nums)

    # Map the sorted list of integers back to their corresponding string values using the dictionary
    sorted_words = map(num -> findfirst(isequal(num), num_dict)[1], sorted_nums)

    # Join the list of string values into a single string with spaces between each word
    return join(sorted_words, " ")
end
```

This function should work as expected for the given examples.
