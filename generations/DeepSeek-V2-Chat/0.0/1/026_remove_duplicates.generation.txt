Here's the implementation of the `remove_duplicates` function in Julia:

```julia
function remove_duplicates(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    seen = Set{Int}()
    result = Vector{Int}()

    for num in numbers
        if !(num in seen)
            push!(result, num)
            push!(seen, num)
        end
    end

    return result
end
```

This function iterates through the input list `numbers`, using a `Set` to keep track of elements that have already been encountered. If an element is not in the `Set`, it is added to both the `result` list and the `Set`. This ensures that only elements that occur exactly once are kept in the output list, maintaining the order of the elements as in the input.
