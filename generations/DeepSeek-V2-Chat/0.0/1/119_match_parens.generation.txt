To solve the problem of determining if two strings of parentheses can be concatenated to form a balanced string, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of open and close parentheses in each string.
2. Check if the total number of open parentheses equals the total number of close parentheses.
3. Ensure that the number of unmatched open parentheses (after considering the close parentheses from the second string) does not exceed the number of open parentheses in the first string.

Here's the implementation of the `match_parens` function in Julia:

```julia
function match_parens(lst::Vector{String})::String
    # Count the number of open and close parentheses in each string
    count_open1 = count(c -> c == '(', lst[1])
    count_close1 = count(c -> c == ')', lst[1])
    count_open2 = count(c -> c == '(', lst[2])
    count_close2 = count(c -> c == ')', lst[2])
    
    # Total open and close parentheses
    total_open = count_open1 + count_open2
    total_close = count_close1 + count_close2
    
    # Check if the total number of open parentheses equals the total number of close parentheses
    if total_open != total_close
        return "No"
    end
    
    # Check if the number of unmatched open parentheses does not exceed the number of open parentheses in the first string
    if count_open1 >= count_close2
        return "Yes"
    else
        return "No"
    end
end

# Examples
println(match_parens(["()(", ")"]))  # "Yes"
println(match_parens([")", ")"]))    # "No"
```

This function works by first counting the parentheses in each string, then checking if the total number of open and close parentheses match. Finally, it ensures that the first string has enough open parentheses to match the close parentheses from the second string. If all conditions are met, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".
