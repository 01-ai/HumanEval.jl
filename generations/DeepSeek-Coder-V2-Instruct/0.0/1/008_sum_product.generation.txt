 Here's the implementation of the `sum_product` function in Julia:

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    sum_result = sum(numbers)
    product_result = prod(numbers)
    return (sum_result, product_result)
end
```

This function calculates the sum and product of all integers in the given list and returns them as a tuple. If the list is empty, the sum will be 0 and the product will be 1, as per the behavior of `sum` and `prod` functions in Julia.
