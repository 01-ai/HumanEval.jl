Here is the Julia function that implements the given problem:

```julia
function reverse_delete(s::String, c::String)::Tuple{String, Bool}
    result = filter(x -> !(x in c), s)
    is_palindrome = result == reverse(result)
    return (result, is_palindrome)
end
```

This function uses the `filter` function to remove all characters in `s` that are in `c`. It then checks if the resulting string is the same as its reverse, which is the definition of a palindrome. The function returns a tuple containing the result string and a boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome.
