Here's the implementation of the `incr_list` function in Julia:

```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    return xs .+ 1
end
```

Explanation:
- The function takes a vector `xs` as input.
- It uses the `.+` broadcasting operator to add 1 to each element of the vector.
- The function returns the resulting vector with incremented elements.

The `.+` broadcasting operator applies the addition operation element-wise to the vector, incrementing each element by 1.

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
julia> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 4

julia> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
9-element Vector{Int64}:
   6
   4
   6
   3
   4
   4
  10
   1
 124
```

The function works as expected, returning a new vector with each element incremented by 1.
