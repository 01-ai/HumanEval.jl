Here is the Julia implementation of the `sum_squares` function based on the provided docstring:

```julia
function sum_squares(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    for i in eachindex(xs)
        if i % 3 == 0
            xs[i] = xs[i]^2
        elseif i % 4 == 0
            xs[i] = xs[i]^3
        end
    end
    return sum(xs)
end
```

This function iterates over the indices of the input vector `xs`. If the index is a multiple of 3, the corresponding element is squared. If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, the corresponding element is cubed. The function then returns the sum of all elements in the modified vector `xs`.
