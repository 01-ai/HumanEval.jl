Here is the Julia function `is_nested` that matches the provided doc string:

```julia
function is_nested(s::String)::Bool
    # Initialize a counter for the balance of brackets
    balance = 0
    # Initialize a variable to track if we have seen a nested bracket
    nested = false

    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for c in s
        if c == '['
            # Increment balance when we see an opening bracket
            balance += 1
        elseif c == ']'
            # Decrement balance when we see a closing bracket
            balance -= 1
            # If balance is greater than zero after decrement, we have a nested bracket
            if balance > 0
                nested = true
            end
        end
        # If balance goes negative, we have an invalid sequence
        if balance < 0
            return false
        end
    end

    # Return true if we have seen a nested bracket and balance is zero at the end
    return nested && balance == 0
end
```

This function checks for a valid sequence of brackets and also ensures that at least one bracket is nested. It returns `true` if these conditions are met, and `false` otherwise.
