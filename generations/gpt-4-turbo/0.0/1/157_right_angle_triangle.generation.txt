```julia
function right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool
    # Sort the sides to ensure a and b are the smaller two, and c is the hypotenuse
    a, b, c = sort([a, b, c])
    
    # Check if the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides
    return a^2 + b^2 == c^2
end
