Sure, here is the implementation of the `fizz_buzz` function in Julia:

```julia
function fizz_buzz(n::Int)
    count = 0
    for i in 1:n-1
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0
            count += count_occurrences_of_7(i)
        end
    end
    return count
end

function count_occurrences_of_7(num::Int)
    count = 0
    while num > 0
        if num % 10 == 7
            count += 1
        end
        num = div(num, 10)
    end
    return count
end
```

This function `fizz_buzz` iterates through all integers less than `n` and checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13. If they are, it counts the occurrences of the digit 7 in those numbers using the helper function `count_occurrences_of_7`. The helper function `count_occurrences_of_7` counts how many times the digit 7 appears in a given number.
