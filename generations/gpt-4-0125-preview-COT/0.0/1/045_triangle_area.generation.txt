### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to calculate the area of a triangle given the length of a side (`a`) and the height (`h`) to that side.

2. **Formula**: The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula: 
   \[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
   In this case, `base` corresponds to `a` and `height` corresponds to `h`.

3. **Implement the Function**: Write a Julia function named `triangle_area` that takes two arguments, `a` and `h`, and returns the area of the triangle using the formula mentioned above.

4. **Return the Result**: The function should calculate the area and return the result.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
"""
    triangle_area(a, h)

Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```
"""
function triangle_area(a, h)
    # Calculate the area using the formula
    area = 0.5 * a * h
    return area
end
```

This function follows the steps outlined above to calculate and return the area of a triangle given the length of a side and the height.
