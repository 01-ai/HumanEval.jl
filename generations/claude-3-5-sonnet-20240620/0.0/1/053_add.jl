"""

This appears to be a Julia function docstring for a function called `add`. Let me break it down for you:

1. The function signature is `add(x::Int, y::Int)`, which means:
   - The function name is `add`
   - It takes two parameters, `x` and `y`
   - Both parameters are of type `Int` (integer)

2. The description says "Add two numbers `x` and `y`.", which explains the purpose of the function.

3. The "Examples" section provides usage examples:
   - The first example shows that `add(2, 3)` returns `5`
   - The second example shows that `add(5, 7)` returns `12`

4. The `jldoctest` tag indicates that these examples are doctests, which means they can be automatically run to verify the function's behavior.

This docstring follows Julia's documentation conventions and provides clear information about the function's purpose, parameters, and usage. It's a good practice for making code more understandable and maintainable.

The actual implementation of the function is not shown in this docstring. The function body would typically follow this docstring in the actual code file.
