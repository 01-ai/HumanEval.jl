    min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}

Given a grid with `N` rows and `N` columns (`N >= 2`) and a positive integer
`k`, each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range `[1, N * N]` inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start from
any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells, in other
words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current cell.

Please note that a path of length `k` means visiting exactly `k` cells (not
necessarily distinct).

You CANNOT go off the grid.

A path `A` (of length k) is considered less than a path `B` (of length k) if
after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that `A` and `B` go
through (let's call them `lst_A` and `lst_B`), `lst_A` is lexicographically less
than `lst_B`, in other words, there exist an integer index `i` (1 <= i <= k)
such that `lst_A[i] < lst_B[i]` and for any `j` (1 <= j < i) we have `lst_A[j] = lst_B[j]`. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique. Return an ordered list of
the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> min_path([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]], 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 1

julia> min_path([[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]], 1)
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
```

To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in the grid, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start by identifying the dimensions of the grid `N` and initializing a priority queue to manage the paths based on their lexicographical order.

2. **BFS Setup**: For each cell in the grid, initiate a BFS. Use a priority queue to store the paths, where each path is represented by a tuple containing:
   - The current path as a list of values.
   - The current position in the grid (row, column).
   - The length of the path so far.

3. **Path Expansion**: In each step of BFS:
   - Extract the path with the smallest lexicographical order from the priority queue.
   - If the path length equals `k`, compare it with the current best path and update if it's better.
   - Otherwise, expand the path by moving to neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) that are within the grid boundaries.
   - Add the new paths back to the priority queue.

4. **Termination**: Once all possible paths of length `k` have been considered, the best path found will be the answer.

5. **Optimization Considerations**: Given the constraints and the nature of BFS, the algorithm should efficiently find the minimum path due to the priority queue ensuring that the smallest lexicographical paths are considered first.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from every cell, and always expand the smallest path first, leading to an efficient discovery of the minimum path.
