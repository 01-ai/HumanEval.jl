```julia
function make_a_pile(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Initialize the pile with the first level
    pile = [n]
    
    # Loop through the levels, adding the next odd or even number
    while length(pile) < n
        if n % 2 == 1
            # If n is odd, add the next odd number
            push!(pile, n + 2)
            n += 2
        else
            # If n is even, add the next even number
            push!(pile, n + 1)
            n += 1
        end
    end
    
    return pile
end
```

This function takes a positive integer `n` and returns a vector of integers representing the pile of stones. The first level has `n` stones, and each subsequent level has the next odd or even number depending on whether `n` is odd or even. The function continues to add levels until there are `n` levels in the pile.
