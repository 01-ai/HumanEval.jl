Here is a Julia function that implements the given problem:

```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            return i - 1
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```

This function works by iterating over the given array `xs` from the second element to the end. For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous one. If it is, the function returns the index of the previous element (since Julia is 1-indexed, we subtract 1 from `i`). If no such element is found after iterating over the entire array, the function returns -1.

Here is how you can test the function:

```julia
println(can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]))  # Output: 4
println(can_arrange([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: -1
```
