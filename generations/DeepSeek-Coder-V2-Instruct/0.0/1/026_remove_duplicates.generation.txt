 Here's the implementation of the `remove_duplicates` function in Julia:

```julia
function remove_duplicates(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each number
    counts = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for number in numbers
        if haskey(counts, number)
            counts[number] += 1
        else
            counts[number] = 1
        end
    end

    # Filter out numbers that occur more than once
    result = [number for number in numbers if counts[number] == 1]
    return result
end
```

This function first counts the occurrences of each number using a dictionary. Then, it filters the original list to keep only those numbers that occur exactly once. The order of the elements is preserved as required.
