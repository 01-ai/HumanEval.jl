Here's a Julia function that solves the problem you've described:

```julia
function below_zero(operations::Vector{Int})::Bool
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This function does the following:

1. We initialize a `balance` variable to 0, representing the starting balance of the account.

2. We iterate through each operation in the `operations` vector.

3. For each operation, we add it to the balance. (Positive numbers represent deposits, negative numbers represent withdrawals.)

4. After each operation, we check if the balance has fallen below zero. If it has, we immediately return `true`.

5. If we've gone through all operations without the balance ever falling below zero, we return `false`.

This function will correctly handle the examples you provided:

```julia
julia> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
false

julia> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
true
```

In the first example, the balance never goes below zero (it goes from 0 to 1 to 3 to 6), so the function returns `false`.

In the second example, after the third operation (-4), the balance becomes -1, which is below zero, so the function returns `true`.

This solution is efficient as it stops as soon as it detects a balance below zero, and it only needs to go through the list of operations once, giving it a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of operations.
