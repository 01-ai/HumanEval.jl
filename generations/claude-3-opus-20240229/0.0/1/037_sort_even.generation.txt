Here's the implementation of the `sort_even` function in Julia:

```julia
function sort_even(l::Vector)::Vector
    # Create a copy of the input vector
    l′ = copy(l)
    
    # Get the even indices of the vector
    even_indices = 2:2:length(l)
    
    # Sort the values at even indices
    sorted_even = sort(l[even_indices])
    
    # Update the even indices of l′ with the sorted values
    l′[even_indices] = sorted_even
    
    return l′
end
```

Explanation:

1. We start by creating a copy of the input vector `l` using the `copy` function. This ensures that we don't modify the original vector.

2. We generate a range of even indices using `2:2:length(l)`. This range starts from 2 (the first even index) and increments by 2 until the length of the vector.

3. We extract the values at the even indices of `l` using `l[even_indices]` and sort them using the `sort` function. The sorted values are stored in the `sorted_even` variable.

4. We update the even indices of `l′` with the sorted values using `l′[even_indices] = sorted_even`. This step replaces the values at the even indices of `l′` with the sorted values.

5. Finally, we return the modified vector `l′`.

The function satisfies the given examples:

```julia
julia> sort_even([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
true

julia> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]) == [5, 4, 3, 6]
true
```

In the first example, the input vector `[1, 2, 3]` has no even indices, so the function returns the same vector.

In the second example, the even indices are 2 and 4. The values at these indices are 6 and 4. After sorting, the values become 4 and 6, and they are updated in the even indices of the resulting vector `[5, 4, 3, 6]`.
