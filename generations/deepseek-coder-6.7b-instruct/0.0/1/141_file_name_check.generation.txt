Here is the Julia function based on the given doc string:

```julia
function file_name_check(file_name::String)::String
    # Check if there is exactly one dot in the file name
    if count(isequal('.'), file_name) != 1
        return "No"
    end

    # Split the file name into name and extension
    parts = split(file_name, ".")
    name, extension = parts[1], parts[2]

    # Check if the name starts with a letter and there are no more than three digits
    if !(isa(name[1], Char) && all(isa(c, Char) ? '0' <= c <= '9' : true, name[2:end]))
        return "No"
    end

    # Check if the extension is one of the allowed ones
    if !(extension in ["txt", "exe", "dll"])
        return "No"
    end

    return "Yes"
end
```

This function first checks if the file name contains exactly one dot. If not, it returns "No". Then it splits the file name into a name and an extension. It checks if the name starts with a letter and contains no more than three digits. If not, it returns "No". Finally, it checks if the extension is one of the allowed ones. If not, it returns "No". If all checks pass, it returns "Yes".
