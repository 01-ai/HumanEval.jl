Sure, here is the Julia function that implements the given docstring:

```julia
function count_digits(n::Int)::Int
    product = 1
    while n > 0
        digit = n % 10
        if digit % 2 != 0
            product *= digit
        end
        n = div(n, 10)
    end
    return product
end
```
This function works by repeatedly taking the last digit of `n` using the modulo operator `%`, checking if it's odd, and if so, multiplying it into the `product`. The number `n` is then updated by removing the last digit using integer division `div`. The process continues until all digits have been processed. If all digits are even, the `product` remains 1 and the function returns 0 as per the problem statement.
