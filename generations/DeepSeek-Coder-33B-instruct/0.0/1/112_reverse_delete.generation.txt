Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function reverse_delete(s::String, c::String)::Tuple{String, Bool}
    # Remove all characters in s that are in c
    s = filter(x -> !(x in c), s)

    # Check if the result string is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = s == reverse(s)

    # Return the result string and the check
    return s, is_palindrome
end
```

This function works by first filtering out all characters in `s` that are also in `c`. It then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. The function returns a tuple containing the resulting string and a boolean indicating whether or not it is a palindrome.
