Here is the Julia function that implements the Mean Absolute Deviation calculation based on the provided docstring:
```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    x_mean = mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute differences between each element and the mean
    absolute_diffs = [abs(x - x_mean) for x in numbers]
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences
    mad = mean(absolute_diffs)
    
    return mad
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We first calculate the mean of the input numbers using the `mean` function from the Julia standard library.
2. We then calculate the absolute differences between each element and the mean using a list comprehension. This creates a new vector `absolute_diffs` containing the absolute differences.
3. Finally, we calculate the mean of the absolute differences using the `mean` function again. This gives us the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).
4. The MAD is returned as the result of the function.

You can test this function using the example provided in the docstring:
```julia
julia> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```
This should output `1.0`, which is the expected result.
