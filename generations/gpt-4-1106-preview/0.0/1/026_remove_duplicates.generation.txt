Certainly! Below is the Julia function `remove_duplicates` that removes all elements that occur more than once from a list of integers, while preserving the order of the remaining elements:

```julia
function remove_duplicates(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    counts = Dict{Int, Int}()
    unique_numbers = Int[]

    for num in numbers
        counts[num] = get(counts, num, 0) + 1
    end

    for num in numbers
        if counts[num] == 1
            push!(unique_numbers, num)
        end
    end

    return unique_numbers
end

# Examples
println(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

This function uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the input vector. Then, it iterates through the input vector again, adding numbers to the result vector only if they occurred exactly once.
