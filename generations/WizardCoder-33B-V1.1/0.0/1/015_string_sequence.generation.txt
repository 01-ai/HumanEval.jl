Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function string_sequence(n::Int)::String
    return join(string.(0:n), " ")
end
```

This function works by first creating a range from 0 to `n`, then converting each number in the range to a string using the `string` function, and finally joining all the strings together with a space in between.
