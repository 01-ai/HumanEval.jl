Here's the implementation of the `incr_list` function in Julia:

```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    return xs .+ 1
end
```

This function uses the broadcast operator `.+` to increment each element of the input vector `xs` by 1. The result is a new vector with the incremented values.
