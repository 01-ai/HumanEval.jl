Here is the Julia function based on the given doc string:

```julia
function make_a_pile(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    stones = Int[]
    for i in 1:n
        push!(stones, n + 2*(i-1))
    end
    return stones
end
```

This function creates an empty vector `stones` and then iterates over the range from 1 to `n`. In each iteration, it calculates the number of stones for the current level by adding `2*(i-1)` to `n` if `n` is even or `2*(i-1)` to `n+1` if `n` is odd, and then appends this number to the `stones` vector. Finally, it returns the `stones` vector.
