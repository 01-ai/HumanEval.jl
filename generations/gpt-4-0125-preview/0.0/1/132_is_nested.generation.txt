To implement the `is_nested` function, we can use a simple counter to keep track of the depth of nesting of the brackets. We increment the counter for each opening bracket `[` and decrement it for each closing bracket `]`. If at any point the counter is greater than 1, it means we have a nested bracket. We also need to ensure that the counter never goes below 0 at any point before the end of the string, as this would indicate an invalid sequence of brackets (a closing bracket before an opening one). Here's how you can implement it:

```julia
function is_nested(s::String)::Bool
    depth = 0  # Initialize depth counter
    for c in s
        if c == '['
            depth += 1  # Increment depth for opening bracket
        elseif c == ']'
            depth -= 1  # Decrement depth for closing bracket
        end
        if depth > 1
            return true  # Found a nested bracket
        end
        if depth < 0
            return false  # Invalid sequence, closing before opening
        end
    end
    return false  # No nested brackets found
end
```

This function iterates through each character in the string, adjusting the depth based on whether the character is an opening or closing bracket. It checks for nested brackets (depth > 1) and invalid sequences (depth < 0) during the iteration. If it completes the iteration without finding a nested bracket or encountering an invalid sequence, it returns `false`.
