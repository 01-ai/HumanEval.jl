Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function in Julia:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean_value = mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute deviations from the mean
    absolute_deviations = abs.(numbers .- mean_value)
    
    # Calculate the mean absolute deviation
    mad = mean(absolute_deviations)
    
    return mad
end

# Example usage
# julia> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
```

Make sure to include the `Statistics` module for the `mean` function to work:

```julia
using Statistics
```

Now you can use the `mean_absolute_deviation` function to calculate the mean absolute deviation of a vector of `Float64` numbers.
