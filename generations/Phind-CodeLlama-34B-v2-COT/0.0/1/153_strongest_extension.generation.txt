To solve this problem, we will first create a function that calculates the strength of an extension. Then, we will iterate through the list of extensions, calculating their strength and comparing it to the current strongest. If an extension has a greater strength, it becomes the new strongest. Finally, we return the class name and the strongest extension name.

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Define a function `strength(extension::String)::Int` that calculates the strength of an extension.
2. Define the main function `strongest_extension(class_name::String, extensions::Vector{String})::String`.
3. Initialize a variable `strongest_strength` to `Int` and set it to `-Inf` and a variable `strongest_extension` to `String` and set it to an empty string.
4. Iterate over each extension in the extensions list.
5. For each extension, calculate its strength using the `strength` function.
6. Compare the strength of the current extension with `strongest_strength`.
7. If the current extension's strength is greater, update `strongest_strength` and `strongest_extension`.
8. After the loop, return the class name and the strongest extension name in the required format.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function strength(extension::String)::Int
    CAP = count(isuppercase, extension)
    SM = count(islowercase, extension)
    return CAP - SM
end

function strongest_extension(class_name::String, extensions::Vector{String})::String
    strongest_strength = -Inf
    strongest_extension = ""

    for extension in extensions
        current_strength = strength(extension)
        if current_strength > strongest_strength
            strongest_strength = current_strength
            strongest_extension = extension
        end
    end

    return "$class_name.$strongest_extension"
end
```

This code should solve the problem as expected. It calculates the strength of each extension and finds the one with the greatest strength. If there are multiple extensions with the same strength, it chooses the first one as required by the problem statement.
