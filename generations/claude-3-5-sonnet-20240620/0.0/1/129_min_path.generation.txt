To solve this problem, we'll implement a function that performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. Here's a Julia implementation of the `min_path` function:

```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = length(grid)
    best_path = fill(typemax(Int), k)
    
    function dfs(row, col, depth, current_path)
        if depth == k
            if current_path < best_path
                best_path .= current_path
            end
            return
        end
        
        for (dr, dc) in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
            new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
            if 1 <= new_row <= N && 1 <= new_col <= N
                new_path = copy(current_path)
                new_path[depth + 1] = grid[new_row][new_col]
                dfs(new_row, new_col, depth + 1, new_path)
            end
        end
    end
    
    for row in 1:N
        for col in 1:N
            dfs(row, col, 1, [grid[row][col]])
        end
    end
    
    return best_path
end
```

Let's break down the implementation:

1. We initialize `best_path` with the maximum possible integer values to ensure that any valid path will be considered better at first.

2. We define a nested `dfs` function that performs the depth-first search:
   - It takes the current `row`, `col`, `depth`, and `current_path` as arguments.
   - If we've reached the desired path length `k`, we compare the current path with the best path found so far and update if necessary.
   - Otherwise, we explore all four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).
   - For each valid neighbor, we create a new path by appending the neighbor's value and recursively call `dfs`.

3. We iterate through all cells in the grid as starting points for the DFS.

4. Finally, we return the `best_path` found.

This implementation will find the lexicographically smallest path of length `k` in the grid, considering all possible starting points and movements to neighboring cells.

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(N^2 * 4^k), where N is the grid size and k is the path length. For large grids or long paths, this might be slow. In such cases, more optimized approaches (like dynamic programming or A* search) might be necessary.
