```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case
    lowercase_s = lowercase(s)

    # Create a set to store unique characters
    unique_chars = Set()

    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in lowercase_s
        # Add the character to the set
        push!(unique_chars, char)
    end

    # Return the length of the set
    return length(unique_chars)
end
```

This function converts the input string to lowercase to ignore case, iterates through each character in the string, and adds it to a set if it is not already present. The set automatically ignores duplicates, so the length of the set is the number of unique characters in the string.
