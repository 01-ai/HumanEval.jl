```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean_value = mean(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the absolute differences from the mean
    differences = abs.(numbers .- mean_value)
    
    # Calculate the mean of the absolute differences
    return mean(differences)
end
```

This function calculates the mean absolute deviation of a vector of `Float64` numbers by first finding the mean of the numbers, then calculating the absolute differences between each number and the mean, and finally taking the mean of those absolute differences.
