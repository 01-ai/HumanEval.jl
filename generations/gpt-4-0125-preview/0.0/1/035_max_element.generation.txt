Certainly! Below is the Julia function `max_element` that takes a list `xs` and returns the maximum element in the list.

```julia
function max_element(xs)
    # Check if the list is empty
    if isempty(xs)
        error("List is empty")
    end

    # Initialize max_val with the first element of the list
    max_val = xs[1]

    # Iterate through the list to find the maximum value
    for x in xs
        if x > max_val
            max_val = x
        end
    end

    return max_val
end
```

This function starts by checking if the list is empty and raises an error if it is. It then initializes `max_val` with the first element of the list. It iterates through the list, updating `max_val` whenever it finds an element greater than the current `max_val`. Finally, it returns `max_val` as the maximum element in the list.
