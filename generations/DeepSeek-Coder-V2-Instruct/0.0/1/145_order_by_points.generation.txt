 Here's the implementation of the `order_by_points` function in Julia:

```julia
function order_by_points(nums::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
    function sum_of_digits(n::Int)::Int
        sum(abs(n) |> string |> collect .|> x -> parse(Int, x))
    end

    # Sort the numbers based on the sum of their digits, and by their original index if sums are equal
    sorted_nums = sort(nums, by = n -> (sum_of_digits(n), findfirst(x -> x == n, nums)))

    return sorted_nums
end
```

This function first defines a helper function `sum_of_digits` to calculate the sum of the digits of a given number. It then sorts the input vector `nums` based on the sum of the digits of each number. If two numbers have the same sum of digits, they are ordered based on their original index in the list.
