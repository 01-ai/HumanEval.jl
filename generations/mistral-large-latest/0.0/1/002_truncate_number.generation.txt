Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function truncate_number(number::Float64)::Float64
    # Check if the number is positive
    if number >= 0
        # Use the mod function to get the decimal part of the number
        return mod(number, 1)
    else
        error("The input number must be positive")
    end
end
```

This function uses the `mod` function to find the remainder when the number is divided by 1, which is effectively the decimal part of the number. If the number is not positive, it throws an error.
