Here is a Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String
    words = split(sentence, " ")
    isprime(n) = n ≠ 1 && all(n .% 1:n-1 .≠ 0)
    primes = filter(isprime, [length(word) for word in words])
    return join(words[i] for i in primes)
end
```

This function first splits the sentence into words. Then it creates a list of the lengths of the words. It filters this list to only include prime numbers. Finally, it joins the words whose lengths are prime numbers into a string, maintaining the original order.

The `isprime` function checks if a number is prime by checking if it is not divisible by any number up to itself. The `filter` function is used to get the words whose lengths are prime numbers. The `join` function is used to create the final string.

This function assumes that the sentence contains only letters and spaces. If the sentence contains punctuation, it should be removed before calling this function.
