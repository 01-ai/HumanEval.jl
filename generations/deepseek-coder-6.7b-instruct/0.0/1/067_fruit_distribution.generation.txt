Here is the Julia function based on the given doc string:

```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    m = match(r"(\d+) apples and (\d+) oranges", s)
    apples = parse(Int, m.captures[1])
    oranges = parse(Int, m.captures[2])
    return n - apples - oranges
end
```

This function uses a regular expression to extract the number of apples and oranges from the input string. It then subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to find the number of mangoes.

You can test this function with the examples provided in the doc string:

```julia
julia> fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19)
8

julia> fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3)
2

julia> fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)
95

julia> fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)
19
```
