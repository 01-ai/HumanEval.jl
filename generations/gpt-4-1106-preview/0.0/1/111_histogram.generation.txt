Here is the Julia function `histogram` that implements the functionality described in the doc string:

```julia
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    # Split the string into words and filter out empty strings
    words = filter(!isempty, split(s, ' '))
    
    # Create a dictionary to count the occurrences of each letter
    counts = Dict{String, Int}()
    for word in words
        counts[word] = get(counts, word, 0) + 1
    end
    
    # Find the maximum count
    max_count = maximum(values(counts), init=0)
    
    # Filter the dictionary to only include letters with the maximum count
    max_count_letters = Dict(filter(pair -> pair[2] == max_count, counts))
    
    return max_count_letters
end
```

You can use this function to create a histogram of the most frequent letters in a space-separated string. Here are some examples of how to use the function:

```julia
println(histogram("a b c"))
println(histogram("a b b a"))
println(histogram("a b c a b"))
println(histogram("b b b b a"))
println(histogram(""))
```

Each call to `histogram` will print the dictionary containing the letters with the highest frequency and their counts. If the string is empty, it will return an empty dictionary.
