### Outline to implement the `move_one_ball` function

1. Check if the input array `xs` is empty. If it is, return `true` because an empty array is trivially sorted.
2. Find the index where the array is not sorted (i.e., where `xs[i] > xs[i+1]`). This step involves iterating through the array and checking the condition for each pair of adjacent elements.
3. If no such index is found, the array is already sorted, and we return `true`.
4. If such an index is found, check if the subarray starting from the next index to the end of the array is sorted in non-decreasing order and if the last element of the array is less than or equal to the first element of the array. This is because a right shift operation would place the last element at the beginning.
5. If the subarray is sorted and the last element is less than or equal to the first element, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Julia code for the `move_one_ball` function

```julia
function move_one_ball(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # Step 1: Check if the array is empty
    if isempty(xs)
        return true
    end
    
    # Step 2: Find the index where the array is not sorted
    n = length(xs)
    index = 0
    for i in 1:(n-1)
        if xs[i] > xs[i+1]
            index = i
            break
        end
    end
    
    # Step 3: If no such index is found, the array is already sorted
    if index == 0
        return true
    end
    
    # Step 4: Check if the subarray is sorted and the last element is less than or equal to the first element
    for i in (index+1):(n-1)
        if xs[i] > xs[i+1]
            return false
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return true if the last element is less than or equal to the first element
    return xs[n] <= xs[1]
end
```

Now, let's implement the function in Julia.
