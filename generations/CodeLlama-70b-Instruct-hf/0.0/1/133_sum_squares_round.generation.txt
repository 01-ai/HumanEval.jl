```julia
function sum_squares_round(xs::Vector)::Int
    sum = 0
    for x in xs
        sum += ceil(Int, x)^2
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates over the elements of the input vector `xs`, rounds each element to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function, squares the rounded value, and adds it to the `sum` variable. Finally, it returns the total sum.
