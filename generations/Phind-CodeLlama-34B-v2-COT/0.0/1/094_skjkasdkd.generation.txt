To solve this problem, we will first write a helper function to check if a number is prime or not. Then, we will iterate through the given list of integers and find the largest prime number. Finally, we will return the sum of its digits.

Step-by-step outline:

1. Write a helper function `is_prime(n::Int)::Bool` to check if a number is prime or not.
2. Iterate through the given list of integers.
3. For each integer, check if it is prime using the helper function.
4. If it is prime, check if it is larger than the current largest prime number.
5. If it is larger, update the largest prime number.
6. After iterating through all the integers, calculate and return the sum of its digits.

Now, let's write the Julia code.

```julia
function is_prime(n::Int)::Bool
    if n <= 1
        return false
    elseif n <= 3
        return true
    elseif n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0
        return false
    end
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n
        if n % i == 0 || n % (i + 2) == 0
            return false
        end
        i += 6
    end
    return true
end

function skjkasdkd(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    largest_prime = -1
    for x in xs
        if is_prime(x)
            largest_prime = max(largest_prime, x)
        end
    end
    if largest_prime == -1
        return 0
    else
        return sum(digits(largest_prime))
    end
end
```

This code first checks if a number is divisible by 2 or 3. If not, it checks divisibility by potential factors, starting from 5 and incrementing by 6 each time (since all primes are of the form 6k Â± 1). If the number is larger than the current largest prime, it updates the largest prime. After finding the largest prime, it calculates and returns the sum of its digits. If no prime number is found, it returns 0.
