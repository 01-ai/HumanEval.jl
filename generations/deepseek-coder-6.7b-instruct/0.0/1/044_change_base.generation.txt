Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function change_base(x::Int, base::Int)::String
    if x == 0
        return "0"
    end

    result = ""
    while x > 0
        digit = x % base
        result = string(digit) * result
        x = div(x, base)
    end

    return result
end
```

This function works by repeatedly dividing the input number by the new base and prepending the remainder to the result string. The process continues until the input number is 0. The result string is then returned.
