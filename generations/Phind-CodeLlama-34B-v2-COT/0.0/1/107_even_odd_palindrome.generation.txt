To solve this problem, we will iterate over the range from 1 to n and check if each number is a palindrome. If it is, we will check if it is even or odd and increment the respective counter.

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize two counters, `even_count` and `odd_count`, both initially set to 0.
2. Iterate over the range from 1 to n (inclusive).
3. For each number, check if it is a palindrome.
4. If it is a palindrome, check if it is even or odd and increment the respective counter.
5. After the loop, return the tuple of `even_count` and `odd_count`.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function even_odd_palindrome(n::Int)::Tuple{Int, Int}
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0

    for i in 1:n
        if is_palindrome(i)
            if i % 2 == 0
                even_count += 1
            else
                odd_count += 1
            end
        end
    end

    return (even_count, odd_count)
end

function is_palindrome(n::Int)::Bool
    return string(n) == reverse(string(n))
end
```

In the above code, `is_palindrome` is a helper function that checks if a given number is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it with its reverse.
