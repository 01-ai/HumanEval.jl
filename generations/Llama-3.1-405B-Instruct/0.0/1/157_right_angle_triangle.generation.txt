Here is the Julia function that implements the logic described in the docstring:

```julia
"""
    right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool

Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return `true` if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, `false` otherwise. A right-angled triangle
is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 90 degree.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)
true

julia> right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)
false
```
"""
function right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool
    # Sort the sides in ascending order
    a, b, c = sort([a, b, c])
    
    # Check if the Pythagorean theorem holds
    return a^2 + b^2 ≈ c^2
end
```

This function works by first sorting the sides of the triangle in ascending order. It then checks if the Pythagorean theorem holds, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The `≈` operator is used to check for approximate equality, as floating-point arithmetic can sometimes introduce small errors.
