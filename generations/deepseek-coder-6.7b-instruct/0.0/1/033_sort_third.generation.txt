Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Get the values at the indices divisible by 3
    div_by_three = l[i for i in 1:length(l) if i % 3 == 0]

    # Sort these values
    sorted_div_by_three = sort(div_by_three)

    # Replace the values at the indices divisible by 3 with the sorted values
    for i in 1:length(l)
        if i % 3 == 0
            l[i] = sorted_div_by_three[i � 3]
        end
    end

    return l
end
```

This function first identifies the values at the indices divisible by 3 in the input list `l`. It then sorts these values and replaces the original values at these indices with the sorted values. The modified list is then returned.

Please note that the indices in Julia are 1-based, so the function uses `i % 3 == 0` to check if the index `i` is divisible by 3. The sorted values are then assigned to the original positions in the list `l` using `l[i] = sorted_div_by_three[i � 3]`.
