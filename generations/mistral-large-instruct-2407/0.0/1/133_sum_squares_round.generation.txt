 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `sum_squares_round` function in Julia based on the provided docstring:

```julia
"""
    sum_squares_round(xs::Vector)::Int

You are given a list of numbers. You need to return the sum of squared numbers
in the given list, round each element in the list to the upper int(Ceiling)
first.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum_squares_round([1, 2, 3])
14

julia> sum_squares_round([1, 4, 9])
98

julia> sum_squares_round([1, 3, 5, 7])
84

julia> sum_squares_round([1.4, 4.2, 0])
29

julia> sum_squares_round([-2.4, 1, 1])
6
```
"""
function sum_squares_round(xs::Vector)::Int
    sum = 0
    for x in xs
        rounded_x = ceil(Int, x)
        sum += rounded_x^2
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates through each element in the input vector `xs`, rounds each element up to the nearest integer using the `ceil` function, squares the rounded value, and then sums up all the squared values. The final sum is returned as the result.
