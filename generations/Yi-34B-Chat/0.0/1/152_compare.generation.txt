```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Initialize an array to store the differences
    diffs = Vector{Int}(undef, length(game))

    # Loop over the arrays and calculate the differences
    for i in eachindex(game)
        if game[i] == guess[i]
            # If the guess is correct, the difference is 0
            diffs[i] = 0
        else
            # Otherwise, calculate the absolute difference
            diffs[i] = abs(game[i] - guess[i])
        end
    end

    # Return the array of differences
    return diffs
end
```

This function takes two vectors of equal length, `game` and `guess`, and returns a vector of the same length containing the absolute differences between the guesses and the actual scores, or 0 if the guess is correct.
