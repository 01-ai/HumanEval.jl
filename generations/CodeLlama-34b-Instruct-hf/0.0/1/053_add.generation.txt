  Here is a possible implementation of the `add` function in Julia:
```
function add(x::Int, y::Int)
    return x + y
end
```
This function takes two `Int` arguments `x` and `y`, adds them together, and returns the result.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
```
julia> add(2, 3)
5

julia> add(5, 7)
12
```
As you can see, the function works as expected and returns the sum of the two input numbers.
