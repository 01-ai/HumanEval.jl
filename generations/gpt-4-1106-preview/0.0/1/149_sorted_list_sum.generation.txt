Certainly! Below is the Julia function `sorted_list_sum` that implements the described functionality:

```julia
function sorted_list_sum(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths
    even_length_strings = filter(s -> length(s) % 2 == 0, xs)
    
    # Sort the remaining strings first by length, then alphabetically
    sort(even_length_strings, by = s -> (length(s), s))
end

# Examples
println(sorted_list_sum(["aa", "a", "aaa"])) # Output: ["aa"]
println(sorted_list_sum(["ab", "a", "aaa", "cd"])) # Output: ["ab", "cd"]
```

This function uses the `filter` function to remove strings with odd lengths and then sorts the remaining strings using the `sort` function with a custom sorting key that sorts primarily by string length and secondarily alphabetically.
