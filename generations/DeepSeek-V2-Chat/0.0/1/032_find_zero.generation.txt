To implement the `find_zero` function, we can use the bisection method, which is a root-finding method that repeatedly bisects an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing. This method is particularly suitable for our case since it guarantees convergence to a root under certain conditions.

Here's the implementation of the `find_zero` function:

```julia
"""
Evaluates polynomial with coefficients `xs` at point `x`. Return `xs[1] + xs[2]

  - x + xs[3] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n`.
"""
poly(xs::Vector, x::Float64) = sum(coeff * (x^(i - 1)) for (i, coeff) in enumerate(xs))

"""
    find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})

`xs` are coefficients of a polynomial. `find_zero` find `x` such that `poly(x) = 0`. `find_zero` returns only one zero point, even if there are many. Moreover,
`find_zero` only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest
non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> round(find_zero([1, 2]), digits = 1) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
-0.5

julia> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), digits = 1) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
1.0
```
"""
function find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})
    # Ensure the number of coefficients is even
    @assert length(xs) % 2 == 0 "The number of coefficients must be even."

    # Define the polynomial function
    f(x) = poly(xs, x)

    # Initial interval for bisection method
    a = -10.0
    b = 10.0

    # Ensure the initial interval brackets a root
    while f(a) * f(b) > 0
        a -= 10.0
        b += 10.0
    end

    # Bisection method
    tol = 1e-6
    while (b - a) / 2 > tol
        mid = (a + b) / 2
        if f(mid) == 0
            return mid
        elseif f(a) * f(mid) < 0
            b = mid
        else
            a = mid
        end
    end

    return (a + b) / 2
end
```

This implementation uses the bisection method to find a root of the polynomial defined by the coefficients `xs`. The function `poly` is used to evaluate the polynomial at a given point `x`. The `find_zero` function initializes an interval `[a, b]` and repeatedly narrows it down until the interval is small enough, ensuring that the function value at the midpoint is close to zero. The tolerance `tol` is set to `1e-6` to control the precision of the root finding.
