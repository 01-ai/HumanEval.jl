To implement the `search` function in Julia, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the frequency of each integer in the input list.
2. Identify the integers whose frequency is greater than or equal to the integer itself.
3. Return the greatest integer that satisfies the above condition. If no such integer exists, return -1.

Here's the implementation:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector)::Int
    # Count the frequency of each integer in the list
    freq = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for num in numbers
        if haskey(freq, num)
            freq[num] += 1
        else
            freq[num] = 1
        end
    end

    # Find the greatest integer that meets the condition
    result = -1
    for (num, count) in freq
        if count >= num && num > result
            result = num
        end
    end

    return result
end
```

Let's break down the code:

1. We use a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each integer in the input list.
2. We iterate over the input list `numbers` and update the frequency count in the dictionary.
3. We initialize `result` to -1, which will store the greatest integer that meets the condition.
4. We iterate over the dictionary `freq` to check each integer and its frequency. If the frequency is greater than or equal to the integer and the integer is greater than the current `result`, we update `result`.
5. Finally, we return `result`.

Here are the examples provided in the docstring to test the function:

```julia
println(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 2
println(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: 3
println(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: -1
```

This implementation should correctly handle the given examples and any other valid input according to the problem description.
