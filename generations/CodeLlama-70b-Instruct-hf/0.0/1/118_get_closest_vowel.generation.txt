function get_closest_vowel(word::String)::String
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    vowel_index = 0
    for i in reverse(eachindex(word))
        if word[i] in vowels && i > 1 && i < length(word)
            vowel_index = i
            break
        end
    end
    return vowel_index > 0 ? word[vowel_index] : ""
end
```

This function iterates through the word in reverse order, checking each character to see if it is a vowel. If it is a vowel and is not at the beginning or end of the word, it sets the `vowel_index` to the index of that vowel. If no vowel is found, `vowel_index` remains 0. The function then returns the character at the `vowel_index` if it is greater than 0, or an empty string if it is 0.
