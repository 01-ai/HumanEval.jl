 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `exchange` function in Julia based on the provided docstring:

```julia
"""
    exchange(lst1::Vector{Int}, lst2::Vector{Int})::String

In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements between
them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers. There is no limit on the number
of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2. If it is possible to exchange
elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even,
return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

!!! note

    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])
"YES"

julia> exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])
"NO"
```
"""
function exchange(lst1::Vector{Int}, lst2::Vector{Int})::String
    # Count the number of odd numbers in lst1
    odd_count_lst1 = count(isodd, lst1)

    # Count the number of even numbers in lst2
    even_count_lst2 = count(iseven, lst2)

    # If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in lst2,
    # it is possible to make lst1 all even by exchanging elements.
    if odd_count_lst1 <= even_count_lst2
        return "YES"
    else
        return "NO"
    end
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **Counting Odd Numbers in `lst1`**: We count the number of odd numbers in `lst1` using the `count` function combined with the `isodd` predicate.
2. **Counting Even Numbers in `lst2`**: Similarly, we count the number of even numbers in `lst2` using the `count` function combined with the `iseven` predicate.
3. **Comparison**: If the number of odd numbers in `lst1` is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in `lst2`, it is possible to exchange elements to make all elements in `lst1` even.
4. **Return Result**: Based on the comparison, return "YES" if the exchange is possible, otherwise return "NO".

This implementation ensures that the function correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements in `lst1` even by exchanging elements with `lst2`.
