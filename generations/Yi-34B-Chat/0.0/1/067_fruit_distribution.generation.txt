```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Split the string into apples and oranges counts
    apple_count, orange_count = split(s, " and ")
    apple_count = parse(Int, apple_count)
    orange_count = parse(Int, orange_count)

    # Calculate the total number of fruits without mangoes
    total_fruits = apple_count + orange_count

    # Calculate the number of mango fruits
    mango_count = n - total_fruits

    return mango_count
end
```

This function takes a string `s` that describes the number of apples and oranges, and an integer `n` that represents the total number of fruits in the basket. It splits the string into apple and orange counts, converts them to integers, calculates the total number of fruits without mangoes, and then calculates the number of mango fruits by subtracting the total from the given total number of fruits.
