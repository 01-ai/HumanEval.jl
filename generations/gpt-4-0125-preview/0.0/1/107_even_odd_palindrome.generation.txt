To implement the `even_odd_palindrome` function in Julia, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define the function `even_odd_palindrome` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Initialize two counters, one for even palindromes and one for odd palindromes.
3. Iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and check if each number is a palindrome.
4. If a number is a palindrome, check if it is even or odd and increment the respective counter.
5. Return the tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.

Here's how the implementation looks:

```julia
function even_odd_palindrome(n::Int)::Tuple{Int, Int}
    # Initialize counters for even and odd palindromes
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0

    # Function to check if a number is a palindrome
    is_palindrome = x -> x == parse(Int, join(reverse(string(x))))

    # Iterate through numbers from 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # Check if the current number is a palindrome
        if is_palindrome(i)
            # Increment the even or odd counter based on the number
            if i % 2 == 0
                even_count += 1
            else
                odd_count += 1
            end
        end
    end

    # Return the tuple of even and odd palindrome counts
    return (even_count, odd_count)
end
```

This function works by iterating through each number in the given range, checking if it's a palindrome, and then determining if it's even or odd to update the respective counters. Finally, it returns the counts as a tuple.
