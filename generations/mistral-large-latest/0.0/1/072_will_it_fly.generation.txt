Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the object is balanced (it is a palindromic list)
    is_balanced = q == reverse(q)

    # Check if the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight
    is_light_enough = sum(q) <= w

    # The object will fly if it's balanced and light enough
    return is_balanced && is_light_enough
end
```
This function first checks if the object `q` is balanced by comparing it with its reverse. Then it checks if the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. The function returns `true` if the object is balanced and light enough, and `false` otherwise.
