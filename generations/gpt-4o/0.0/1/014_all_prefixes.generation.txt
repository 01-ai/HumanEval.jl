Sure, here's the implementation of the `all_prefixes` function in Julia:

```julia
"""
    all_prefixes(s::String)::Vector{String}

Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> all_prefixes("abc") == ["a", "ab", "abc"]
true
```
"""
function all_prefixes(s::String)::Vector{String}
    prefixes = String[]
    for i in 1:length(s)
        push!(prefixes, s[1:i])
    end
    return prefixes
end
```

This function iterates over the length of the input string `s` and collects all prefixes from the shortest to the longest in a vector. Each prefix is obtained by slicing the string from the first character to the `i`-th character. The resulting vector of prefixes is then returned.
