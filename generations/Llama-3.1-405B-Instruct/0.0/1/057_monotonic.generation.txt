Here is a Julia function that implements the `monotonic` function as described in the docstring:
```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    increasing = decreasing = true

    for i in 2:length(l)
        if l[i] > l[i-1]
            decreasing = false
        elseif l[i] < l[i-1]
            increasing = false
        end
    end

    return increasing || decreasing
end
```
Here's an explanation of the implementation:

* We initialize two boolean variables `increasing` and `decreasing` to `true`, which will track whether the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, respectively.
* We iterate through the list starting from the second element (index 2).
* For each element, we check if it is greater than the previous element. If it is, we set `decreasing` to `false`, since the list cannot be monotonically decreasing.
* If the element is less than the previous element, we set `increasing` to `false`, since the list cannot be monotonically increasing.
* After iterating through the entire list, we return `true` if either `increasing` or `decreasing` is still `true`, indicating that the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing, respectively.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring:
```julia
julia> monotonic([1, 2, 4, 20])
true

julia> monotonic([1, 20, 4, 10])
false

julia> monotonic([4, 1, 0, -10])
true
```
