### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Check if the list `q` is palindromic.
   - A list is palindromic if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - To check this, compare the list with its reverse.

2. Calculate the sum of the elements in `q`.
   - Use a built-in function to sum up all the elements in the list.

3. Compare the sum of the elements with the maximum possible weight `w`.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to `w`, proceed to the next step.
   - If the sum is greater than `w`, return `false`.

4. Return `true` if the list is palindromic and the sum is within the weight limit; otherwise, return `false`.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Step 1: Check if the list is palindromic
    is_palindromic = q == reverse(q)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the sum of the elements
    sum_of_elements = sum(q)
    
    # Step 3: Compare the sum with the maximum possible weight
    is_within_weight_limit = sum_of_elements <= w
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return is_palindromic && is_within_weight_limit
end
```

Now, let's implement the function in Julia.
