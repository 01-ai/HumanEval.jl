Here's the implementation of the `generate_integers` function in Julia:

```julia
function generate_integers(a::Int, b::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Ensure a is the smaller number and b is the larger number
    a, b = min(a, b), max(a, b)
    
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the even numbers
    even_numbers = Int[]
    
    # Loop through the range from a to b
    for i in a:b
        # Check if the number is even
        if i % 2 == 0
            # Append the even number to the vector
            push!(even_numbers, i)
        end
    end
    
    return even_numbers
end
```

This function first ensures that `a` is the smaller number and `b` is the larger number by using `min` and `max`. It then iterates through the range from `a` to `b`, checking if each number is even. If a number is even, it is added to the `even_numbers` vector. Finally, the function returns the vector of even numbers.
