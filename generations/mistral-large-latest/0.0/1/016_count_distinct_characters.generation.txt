Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case
    lowercase_s = lowercase(s)

    # Use Set to find unique characters and then return the length
    return length(Set(lowercase_s))
end
```

This function first converts the input string to lowercase to ignore case. Then it uses the Set data structure to find the unique characters in the string. Finally, it returns the length of the Set, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.
