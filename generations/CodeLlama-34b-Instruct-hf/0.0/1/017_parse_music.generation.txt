  Here is a possible implementation of the `parse_music` function in Julia:
```
function parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}
    # Create a dictionary to map the musical notes to their duration
    note_durations = Dict("o" => 4, "o|" => 2, ".|" => 1)

    # Split the input string into individual notes
    notes = split(music_string, " ")

    # Create an empty vector to store the note durations
    note_durations = Int[]

    # Iterate over the notes and add their durations to the vector
    for note in notes
        push!(note_durations, note_durations[note])
    end

    return note_durations
end
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. First, we create a dictionary called `note_durations` that maps the musical notes to their duration in beats.
2. Next, we split the input string into individual notes using the `split` function.
3. We create an empty vector called `note_durations` to store the note durations.
4. We iterate over the notes using a `for` loop and add their durations to the `note_durations` vector using the `push!` function.
5. Finally, we return the `note_durations` vector.

Here's an example of how to use the `parse_music` function:
```
julia> parse_music("o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o")
11-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 2
 1
 2
 2
 1
 1
 1
 1
 4
 4
```
This will return a vector of integers representing the duration of each note in the input string.
