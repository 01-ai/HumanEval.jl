Here is the implementation of the decode function in Julia:

```julia
"""
Takes as input string encoded with `encode_shift` function. Returns decoded string.
"""
function decode_shift(s::String)::String
    join(((x - 'a' - 5 + 26) % 26 + 'a' for x in s))
end
```

This function works similarly to the `encode_shift` function, but instead of adding 5 to the character code, it subtracts 5. The addition of 26 before taking the modulus ensures that the result is always non-negative, even if the character code is less than 5.

You can test these functions with a sample string, like this:

```julia
s = "hello"
encoded = encode_shift(s)
println("Encoded: ", encoded)

decoded = decode_shift(encoded)
println("Decoded: ", decoded)
```

This should output the encoded string, and then the original string after decoding.
