Here's a Julia function that implements the `triples_sum_to_zero` functionality as described:

```julia
function triples_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    n = length(l)
    
    # We need at least 3 elements to form a triple
    if n < 3
        return false
    end
    
    # Sort the array to use two-pointer technique
    sort!(l)
    
    for i in 1:n-2
        left = i + 1
        right = n
        
        while left < right
            current_sum = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]
            
            if current_sum == 0
                return true
            elseif current_sum < 0
                left += 1
            else
                right -= 1
            end
        end
    end
    
    return false
end
```

This implementation uses the following approach:

1. First, we check if the input list has at least 3 elements. If not, we return `false` as it's impossible to form a triple.

2. We sort the input list. This allows us to use a two-pointer technique to efficiently search for triples that sum to zero.

3. We iterate through the list, fixing one element at a time (index `i`).

4. For each fixed element, we use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to search for two other elements that, when added to the fixed element, sum to zero.

5. We adjust the `left` and `right` pointers based on whether the current sum is less than, equal to, or greater than zero.

6. If at any point we find a triple that sums to zero, we return `true`.

7. If we've gone through all possibilities without finding a triple that sums to zero, we return `false`.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the input list. It's more efficient than the naive O(n^3) approach of checking all possible triples.

The function correctly handles all the example cases provided:

```julia
julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
false

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
true

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
false

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
true

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
false
```
