# Test cases
println(is_equal_to_sum_even(4)) # false
println(is_equal_to_sum_even(6)) # false
println(is_equal_to_sum_even(8)) # true

# Explanation:
# 4 can't be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
# 6 can't be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
# 8 can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2.
