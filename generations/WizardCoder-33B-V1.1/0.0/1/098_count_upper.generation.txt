Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function count_upper(s::String)::Int
    count = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(s)
        if i % 2 != 0 && isuppercase(c) && c in "AEIOU"
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function works by iterating over the string `s` with an index `i` and character `c`. If `i` is odd and `c` is an uppercase vowel (i.e., `c` is in "AEIOU"), it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.
