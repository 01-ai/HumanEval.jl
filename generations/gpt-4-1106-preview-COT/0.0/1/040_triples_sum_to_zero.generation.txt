### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Define the function `triples_sum_to_zero` that takes a vector of integers `l` as its parameter.
2. Check if the length of the list is less than 3. If it is, return `false` because we need at least three numbers to form a triple.
3. Sort the list to make it easier to avoid checking the same elements multiple times and to use the two-pointer technique.
4. Iterate through the list using a loop. For each element in the list:
   a. Use two pointers to find if there is a pair in the remaining part of the list that sums up with the current element to zero.
   b. The first pointer starts just after the current element, and the second pointer starts from the end of the list.
   c. If the sum of the elements at the two pointers and the current element is zero, return `true`.
   d. If the sum is less than zero, move the first pointer to the right to increase the sum.
   e. If the sum is greater than zero, move the second pointer to the left to decrease the sum.
5. If no such triple is found after the loop, return `false`.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function triples_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # Step 2: Early return if less than 3 elements
    if length(l) < 3
        return false
    end
    
    # Step 3: Sort the list
    sort!(l)
    
    # Step 4: Iterate through the list
    for i in 1:length(l)-2
        # Initialize two pointers
        left = i + 1
        right = length(l)
        
        while left < right
            # Calculate the sum of the current triple
            current_sum = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]
            
            # Step 4c: Check if the sum is zero
            if current_sum == 0
                return true
            # Step 4d: Move the left pointer to the right
            elseif current_sum < 0
                left += 1
            # Step 4e: Move the right pointer to the left
            else
                right -= 1
            end
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return false if no triple found
    return false
end
```

This function should now work as expected and return
