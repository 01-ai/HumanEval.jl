 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `strlen` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    strlen(x::String)::Int

Return length of given string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> strlen("")
0

julia> strlen("abc")
3
```
"""
function strlen(x::String)::Int
    return length(x)
end
```

This function takes a string `x` as input and returns its length using the built-in `length` function in Julia. The examples provided in the docstring demonstrate the expected behavior of the function.
