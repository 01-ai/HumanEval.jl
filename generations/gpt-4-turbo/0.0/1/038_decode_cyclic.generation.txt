To decode the string that was encoded using the `encode_cyclic` function, we need to reverse the cyclic transformation applied during encoding. In the encoding process, for every group of three characters, the positions were cycled as follows: first character moved to the last, and the second and third characters moved one position forward. To decode, we need to reverse this cycle: the last character moves to the first position, and the first and second characters move one position backward.

Here's the implementation of the `decode_cyclic` function:

```julia
function decode_cyclic(s::String)::String
    # Reverse the cyclic transformation applied during encoding
    join((length(x) == 3 ? x[3] * x[1] * x[2] : x for x in Iterators.partition(s, 3)))
end
```

This function uses a similar approach to the encoding function. It partitions the string into groups of three characters and then rearranges each group from the encoded order back to the original order. If a group is not exactly three characters (which can happen if the length of the string is not a multiple of three), it remains unchanged. This matches the behavior of the encoding function, which also leaves the last group unchanged if it's not three characters long.
