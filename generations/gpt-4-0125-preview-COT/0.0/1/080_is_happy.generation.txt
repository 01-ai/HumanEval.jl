### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Check the length of the string**: If the length of the string `s` is less than 3, return `false` immediately because the string cannot be happy according to the definition.

2. **Iterate through the string**: Loop through the string starting from the first character up to the length of the string minus 2. This is because we will be checking the current character, the next one, and the one after that, making a total of 3 characters at a time.

3. **Check for distinct characters in groups of three**: For each position `i` in the string from step 2, check if the character at position `i`, the character at position `i+1`, and the character at position `i+2` are all distinct. If at any point, these three characters are not distinct, return `false`.

4. **Return true if all checks pass**: If the loop completes without finding any group of three consecutive characters that are not distinct, return `true`, indicating the string is happy.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function is_happy(s::String)::Bool
    # Step 1: Check if the length of the string is less than 3
    if length(s) < 3
        return false
    end
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the string
    for i in 1:length(s)-2
        # Step 3: Check for distinct characters in groups of three
        if s[i] == s[i+1] || s[i] == s[i+2] || s[i+1] == s[i+2]
            return false
        end
    end
    
    # Step 4: Return true if all checks pass
    return true
end
```

This function first checks if the string is shorter than 3 characters, in which case it cannot be happy. Then, it iterates through the string, checking every group of three consecutive characters to ensure they are all distinct. If any group of three consecutive characters contains duplicates, the function returns `false`. If no such group is found, the function concludes that the string is happy and returns `true`.
