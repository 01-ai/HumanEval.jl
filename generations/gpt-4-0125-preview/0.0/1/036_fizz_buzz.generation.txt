To implement the `fizz_buzz` function as described, we need to iterate through all integers less than `n` that are divisible by 11 or 13, and count how many times the digit '7' appears in those numbers. Here's how you can do it in Julia:

```julia
function fizz_buzz(n::Int)
    count = 0
    for i in 1:n-1
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0
            # Convert the number to a string to check for the digit '7'
            count += count_digits_7(i)
        end
    end
    return count
end

function count_digits_7(number::Int)
    digits_7 = 0
    for digit in string(number)
        if digit == '7'
            digits_7 += 1
        end
    end
    return digits_7
end
```

This code defines two functions: `fizz_buzz`, which is the main function, and `count_digits_7`, a helper function that counts the number of times the digit '7' appears in an integer. The `fizz_buzz` function iterates through all integers less than `n`, checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and if so, uses `count_digits_7` to count the '7's in each of those numbers.
