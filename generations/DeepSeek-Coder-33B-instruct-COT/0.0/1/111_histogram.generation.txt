Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    # Initialize an empty dictionary
    hist = Dict{String, Int}()

    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)

    # Iterate over each word
    for word in words
        # If the word is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        if haskey(hist, word)
            hist[word] += 1
        # Otherwise, add the word to the dictionary with a count of 1
        else
            hist[word] = 1
        end
    end

    # Find the maximum count
    max_count = maximum(values(hist))

    # Filter the dictionary to only include words with the maximum count
    hist = filter((k, v) -> v == max_count, hist)

    return hist
end
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into words, then iterating over each word. For each word, it checks if the word is already in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count for that word. If it's not, it adds the word to the dictionary with a count of 1. After all words have been processed, it finds the maximum count and filters the dictionary to only include words with that count. The resulting dictionary is then returned.
