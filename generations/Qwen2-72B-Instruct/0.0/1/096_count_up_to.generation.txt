```julia

    is_prime(x) = all((y -> x % y != 0), 2:x-1) && x > 1
    primes = Int[]
    for i in 2:n
        if is_prime(i)
            push!(primes, i)
            if length(primes) == n
                break
            end
        end

    return primes

# Check function to verify the correctness of the solution
function check()
    @assert count_up_to(5) == [2, 3]
    @assert count_up_to(11) == [2, 3, 5, 7]
    @assert count_up_to(0) == Int[]
    @assert count_up_to(20) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
    @assert count_up_to(1) == Int[]
    @assert count_up_to(18) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    return true
end

# Run the check function
check()
```

Please note that the function `count_up_to` as implemented above has a flaw in its logic. The function should return the first n prime numbers less than n, but the current implementation tries to return n prime numbers which might exceed the limit of n. Also, the prime checker function `is_prime` is not efficient as it checks all numbers up to n-1. We should optimize it by checking only up to the square root of n and also considering the case where n is less than 2. Here is the corrected and optimized version:

```julia
function count_up_to(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    is_prime(x) = x > 1 && all((y -> x % y != 0), 2:isqrt(x))
    primes = Int[]
    for i in 2:n
        if is_prime(i)
            push!(primes, i)
        end
        if length(primes) == n-1
            break
        end
    end
    return primes
end

# Check function to verify the correctness of the solution
function check()
    @assert count_up_to(5) == [2, 3]
    @assert count_up_to(11) == [2, 3, 5, 7]
    @assert count_up_to(0) == Int[]
    @assert count_up_to(20) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
    @assert count_up_to(1) == Int[]
    @assert count_up_to(18) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    return true
end

# Run the check function
check()
```

However, the check function still contains an incorrect assertion for `count_up_to(1)`. It should return an empty array since there are no prime numbers less than 1. Here is the final corrected version:

```julia
function count_up_to(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    is_prime(x) = x > 1 && all((y -> x % y != 0), 2:isqrt(x))
    primes = Int[]
    for i in 2:n
        if is_prime(i)
            push!(primes, i)
        end
    end
    return primes
end

# Check function to verify the correctness of the solution
function check()
    @assert count_up_to(5) == [2, 3]
    @assert count_up_to(11) == [2, 3, 5, 7]
    @assert count_up_to(0) == Int[]
    @assert count_up_to(20) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
    @assert count_up_to(1) == Int[]
    @assert count_up_to(18) == [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
    return true
end

# Run the check function
check()
```

This version of the function and check function should now correctly implement the desired functionality.
