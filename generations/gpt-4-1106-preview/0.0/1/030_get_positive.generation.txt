Certainly! Below is the Julia function `get_positive` that takes a vector of integers and returns a new vector containing only the positive numbers from the input vector.

```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector{Int})
    # Filter the vector to include only positive numbers
    return filter(x -> x > 0, xs)
end

# Examples
println(get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6]))
println(get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10]))
```

This function uses the `filter` function to create a new vector that contains only the elements for which the given condition (in this case, being greater than 0) is true.
