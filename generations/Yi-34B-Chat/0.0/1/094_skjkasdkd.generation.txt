```julia
function skjkasdkd(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Initialize the largest prime value to the first element of the list
    largest_prime = xs[1]
    
    # Loop through the list and find the largest prime value
    for x in xs[2:end]
        if isprime(x) && x > largest_prime
            largest_prime = x
        end
    end
    
    # Return the sum of the digits of the largest prime value
    return sum(digits(largest_prime))
end
```

This function defines a `skjkasdkd` function that takes a vector of integers `xs` and returns the sum of the digits of the largest prime value in the list. It initializes the largest prime value to the first element of the list and then iterates through the rest of the list, updating the largest prime value if a prime number greater than the current largest prime is encountered. Finally, it returns the sum of the digits of the largest prime value found.
