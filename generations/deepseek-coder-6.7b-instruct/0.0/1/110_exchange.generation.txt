Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function exchange(lst1::Vector{Int}, lst2::Vector{Int})::String
    odd_lst1 = count(x -> x % 2 != 0, lst1)
    even_lst2 = count(x -> x % 2 == 0, lst2)
    if odd_lst1 <= even_lst2
        return "YES"
    else
        return "NO"
    end
end
```

This function works by first counting the number of odd numbers in lst1 and even numbers in lst2. If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in lst2, it means it's possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make all the elements of lst1 to be even. In this case, the function returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".
