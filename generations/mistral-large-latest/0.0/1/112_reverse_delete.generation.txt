Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function reverse_delete(s::String, c::String)::Tuple{String, Bool}
    result = filter(!in(c), s)
    palindrome = result == reverse(result)
    return (result, palindrome)
end
```

This function works by first filtering out the characters in `s` that are also in `c`. Then it checks if the resulting string is the same as its reverse, which indicates whether it's a palindrome. The function returns a tuple containing the result string and a boolean indicating whether it's a palindrome.
