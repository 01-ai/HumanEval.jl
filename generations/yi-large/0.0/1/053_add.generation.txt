Here is the implementation of the `add` function in Julia, based on the provided doc string:

```julia
function add(x::Int, y::Int)
    return x + y
end
```

This function takes two integers `x` and `y` as input and returns their sum. The doc string provided includes examples that demonstrate how the function can be used, and these examples can be tested using Julia's documentation test (`jldoctest`) to ensure that the function behaves as expected.
