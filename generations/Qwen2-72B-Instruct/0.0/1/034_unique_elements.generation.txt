Here is the Julia function that implements the functionality described in the docstring:

```julia
function unique_elements(l::Vector)
    return sort(unique(l))
end
```

This function first uses the `unique` function to remove duplicate elements from the input vector `l`. Then, it sorts the resulting vector using the `sort` function before returning it. This ensures that the output is a sorted vector of unique elements from the input list.
