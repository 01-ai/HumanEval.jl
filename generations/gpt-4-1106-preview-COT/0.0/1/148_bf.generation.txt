### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Define the function `bf` with parameters `planet1` and `planet2` of type `String`.
2. Create a list of planets in the solar system in order of their distance from the Sun.
3. Check if both `planet1` and `planet2` are in the list of planets. If not, return an empty tuple.
4. Find the indices of `planet1` and `planet2` in the list of planets.
5. Determine the range of indices to include in the result based on the relative positions of `planet1` and `planet2`.
6. Slice the list of planets to get the planets between `planet1` and `planet2`.
7. Return the sliced list as a tuple.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function bf(planet1::String, planet2::String)::NTuple
    # Step 2: List of planets in order from the Sun
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    
    # Step 3: Check if both planets are valid
    if !(planet1 in planets && planet2 in planets)
        return ()
    end
    
    # Step 4: Find indices of the planets
    index1 = findfirst(isequal(planet1), planets)
    index2 = findfirst(isequal(planet2), planets)
    
    # Step 5: Determine the range of indices
    start_index, end_index = min(index1, index2), max(index1, index2)
    
    # Step 6: Slice the list to get the planets in between
    in_between_planets = planets[start_index+1:end_index-1]
    
    # Step 7: Return the result as a tuple
    return tuple(in_between_planets...)
end
```

Let's implement the function in Julia.
