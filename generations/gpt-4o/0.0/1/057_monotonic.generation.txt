Sure, here is the implementation of the `monotonic` function in Julia:

```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    if length(l) <= 1
        return true
    end

    increasing = true
    decreasing = true

    for i in 2:length(l)
        if l[i] > l[i-1]
            decreasing = false
        elseif l[i] < l[i-1]
            increasing = false
        end
    end

    return increasing || decreasing
end
```

This function checks if the elements of the list are either monotonically increasing or decreasing. It does this by iterating through the list and checking the relationship between each pair of consecutive elements. If it finds any pair that violates the monotonicity in either direction, it updates the corresponding flag (`increasing` or `decreasing`). Finally, it returns `true` if either flag remains `true`, indicating that the list is monotonic in at least one direction.
