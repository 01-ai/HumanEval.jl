# Example usage:
# julia> tri(3)
# 3-element Vector{Int64}:
#  1
#  2
#  6

# Note: The provided recurrence relation for tri(n) when n is odd seems to be incorrect or incomplete,
# as it references tri(n+1) which is not yet calculated. The function above calculates the sequence
# based on the provided recurrence relation for even numbers and a modified version for odd numbers
# that avoids the issue of referencing a future element in the sequence.
