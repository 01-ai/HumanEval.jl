Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    open_brackets = 0
    for bracket in brackets
        if bracket == '<'
            open_brackets += 1
        elseif bracket == '>'
            if open_brackets == 0
                return false
            else
                open_brackets -= 1
            end
        end
    end
    return open_brackets == 0
end
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If it encounters an opening bracket "<", it increments a counter. If it encounters a closing bracket ">", it decrements the counter. If at any point the counter goes negative (indicating a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket), it returns false. If it finishes iterating over the string and the counter is not zero (indicating an opening bracket without a corresponding closing bracket), it also returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
