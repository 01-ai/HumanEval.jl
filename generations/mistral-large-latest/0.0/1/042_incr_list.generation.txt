Sure, here is the Julia function that matches your docstring:

```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    return [x + 1 for x in xs]
end
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new vector where each element is the corresponding element in the input vector incremented by 1. The function then returns this new vector.
