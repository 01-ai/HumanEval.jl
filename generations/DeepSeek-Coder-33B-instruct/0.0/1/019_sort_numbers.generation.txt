Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function sort_numbers(numbers::String)::String
    num_dict = Dict("zero" => 0, "one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3, "four" => 4, "five" => 5, "six" => 6, "seven" => 7, "eight" => 8, "nine" => 9)
    num_list = split(numbers)
    sorted_num_list = sort(num_list, by = x -> num_dict[x])
    return join(sorted_num_list, " ")
end
```

This function works by first creating a dictionary that maps each numberal to its corresponding integer value. It then splits the input string into a list of numberals, sorts this list based on the integer values of the numberals, and finally joins the sorted list back into a string.
