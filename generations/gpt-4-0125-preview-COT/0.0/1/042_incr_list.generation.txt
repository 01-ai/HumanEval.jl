### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Define the function** `incr_list` that takes a vector of integers `xs` as its argument.
2. **Increment each element** in the vector by 1. This can be done by mapping a function over `xs` that adds 1 to each element.
3. **Return the modified vector** with all elements incremented by 1.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    # Increment each element by 1 using map and an anonymous function
    return map(x -> x + 1, xs)
end

# Example usage
println(incr_list([1, 2, 3]))
println(incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))
```

This implementation uses the `map` function to apply an anonymous function `(x -> x + 1)` to each element of the input vector `xs`, effectively incrementing each element by 1. The modified vector is then returned.
