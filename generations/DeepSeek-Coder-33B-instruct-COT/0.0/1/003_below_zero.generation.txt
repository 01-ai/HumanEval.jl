Here is a step-by-step outline of how you can solve this problem:

1. Initialize a variable `balance` to 0.
2. Iterate over the `operations` vector.
3. For each operation, add it to the `balance`.
4. If at any point the `balance` becomes less than 0, return `true`.
5. If the loop completes without finding a negative `balance`, return `false`.

Here is the Julia code that implements this algorithm:

```julia
function below_zero(operations::Vector{Int})::Bool
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This function works by iterating over the `operations` vector and adding each operation to the `balance`. If at any point the `balance` becomes less than 0, the function immediately returns `true`. If the loop completes without finding a negative `balance`, the function returns `false`.
