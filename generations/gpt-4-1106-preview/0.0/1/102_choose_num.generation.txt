Here's the Julia function `choose_num` that implements the described functionality:

```julia
function choose_num(x::Int, y::Int)::Int
    # Check if x is greater than y, if so, return -1 as there is no range
    if x > y
        return -1
    end

    # Start from y and go down to x to find the largest even number
    for num in y:-1:x
        if num % 2 == 0
            return num
        end
    end

    # If no even number is found, return -1
    return -1
end
```

You can test this function with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.
