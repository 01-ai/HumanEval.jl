Here is the Julia function `largest_smallest_integers` that implements the described functionality:

```julia
function largest_smallest_integers(xs::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Union{Nothing, Int}, Union{Nothing, Int}}
    # Initialize variables to store the largest negative and smallest positive integers
    largest_negative = nothing
    smallest_positive = nothing

    # Iterate through the list to find the largest negative and smallest positive integers
    for x in xs
        if x < 0
            # Update largest_negative if it's either nothing or found a larger negative number
            if isnothing(largest_negative) || x > largest_negative
                largest_negative = x
            end
        elseif x > 0
            # Update smallest_positive if it's either nothing or found a smaller positive number
            if isnothing(smallest_positive) || x < smallest_positive
                smallest_positive = x
            end
        end
    end

    # Return the tuple with the largest negative and smallest positive integers
    return (largest_negative, smallest_positive)
end
```

You can test this function with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.
