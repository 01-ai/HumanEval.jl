To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into words using the `split` function.
2. For each word, sort the characters based on their ASCII values using the `sort` function.
3. Join the sorted words back into a single string using the `join` function.

Here is the Julia code that implements this algorithm:

```julia
function anti_shuffle(s::String)::String
    # Step 1: Split the input string into words
    words = split(s)

    # Step 2: For each word, sort the characters based on their ASCII values
    sorted_words = map(sort, words)

    # Step 3: Join the sorted words back into a single string
    sorted_string = join(sorted_words, " ")

    return sorted_string
end
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into a vector of words. It then uses the `map` function to apply the `sort` function to each word, creating a new vector of sorted words. Finally, it uses the `join` function to combine the sorted words back into a single string, with a space between each word.
