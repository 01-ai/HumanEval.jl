# Outline

1. Initialize an empty vector to store the number of stones in each level.
2. Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n.
3. In each iteration, check if n is odd or even.
4. If n is odd, add the next odd number to the vector.
5. If n is even, add the next even number to the vector.
6. Return the vector.

# Code

```julia
function make_a_pile(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the number of stones in each level
    pile = Int[]

    # Iterate from 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # Check if n is odd or even
        if n % 2 == 1
            # If n is odd, add the next odd number to the vector
            push!(pile, n + 2)
        else
            # If n is even, add the next even number to the vector
            push!(pile, n + 1)
        end
    end

    # Return the vector
    return pile
end
