Here's a Julia function that implements the requested behavior:

```julia
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # First, replace two or more consecutive spaces with a single dash
    s = replace(s, r" {2,}" => "-")
    
    # Then, replace any remaining single spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")
    
    return s
end
```

This function does the following:

1. It uses a regular expression `r" {2,}"` to match two or more consecutive spaces and replaces them with a single dash `-`.

2. After that, it replaces any remaining single spaces with underscores `_`.

3. Finally, it returns the modified string.

This implementation will handle all the cases mentioned in the examples:

```julia
julia> fix_spaces("Example")
"Example"

julia> fix_spaces("Example 1")
"Example_1"

julia> fix_spaces(" Example 2")
"_Example_2"

julia> fix_spaces(" Example   3")
"_Example-3"
```

Note that this function will also handle cases with more than three consecutive spaces, replacing them all with a single dash. For example:

```julia
julia> fix_spaces("Too    many      spaces")
"Too-many-spaces"
```

This approach ensures that all spaces are replaced according to the specified rules, regardless of how many consecutive spaces appear in the input string.
