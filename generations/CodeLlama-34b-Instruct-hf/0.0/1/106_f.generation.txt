  Here's one way to implement the function `f` based on the given docstring:
```
function f(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    result = Vector{Int}(undef, n)
    for i in 1:n
        if iseven(i)
            result[i] = factorial(i)
        else
            result[i] = sum(1:i)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```
Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a vector of integers of size `n`.
2. We create an empty vector `result` of size `n` to store the output.
3. We loop over the indices `i` from 1 to `n`.
4. For each index `i`, we check if `i` is even using the `iseven` function. If it is even, we calculate the factorial of `i` using the `factorial` function and store it in the `result` vector. If it is odd, we calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to `i` using the `sum` function and store it in the `result` vector.
5. Finally, we return the `result` vector.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
julia> f(5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  2
  6
 24
 15
```
