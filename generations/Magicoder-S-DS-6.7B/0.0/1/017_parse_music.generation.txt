Here is a Julia function that implements the `parse_music` function as described in the problem:

```julia
function parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}
    notes = split(music_string)
    beats = Int[]
    for note in notes
        if note == "o"
            append(beats, 4)
        elseif note == "o|"
            append(beats, 2)
        elseif note == ".|"
            append(beats, 1)
        end
    end
    return beats
end
```

This function splits the input string into individual notes, then iterates over each note. If the note is a whole note (`"o"`), it appends 4 to the `beats` vector. If the note is a half note (`"o|"`), it appends 2 to the `beats` vector. If the note is a quater note (`".|"`), it appends 1 to the `beats` vector. The function finally returns the `beats` vector, which contains the number of beats each note lasts.
