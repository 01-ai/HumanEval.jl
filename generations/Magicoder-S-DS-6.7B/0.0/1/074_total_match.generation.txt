Here is a Julia function that implements the `total_match` function as described in the problem:

```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    sum_xs = sum(length.(xs))
    sum_ys = sum(length.(ys))
    if sum_xs < sum_ys
        return xs
    else
        return ys
    end
end
```

This function works by first calculating the total number of characters in each list using the `sum` function combined with the `length` function. It then compares these sums and returns the list with the smaller sum. If the sums are equal, it returns the first list.
