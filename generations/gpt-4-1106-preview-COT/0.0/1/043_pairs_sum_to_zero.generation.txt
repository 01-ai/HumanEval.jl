### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Define the function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a vector of integers `l` as its parameter.
2. Check if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, return `false` because we need at least two elements to form a pair.
3. Create an empty set to store the elements we have seen so far.
4. Iterate through each element in the list `l`.
   - For each element `x`, check if `-x` (the additive inverse of `x`) is in the set.
   - If `-x` is found in the set, return `true` because we have found a pair that sums to zero.
   - If `-x` is not found, add `x` to the set.
5. If no such pair is found after iterating through the list, return `false`.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function pairs_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # Step 2: Check if the list has less than 2 elements
    if length(l) < 2
        return false
    end

    # Step 3: Create an empty set to store seen elements
    seen = Set{Int}()

    # Step 4: Iterate through each element in the list
    for x in l
        # Check if the additive inverse is in the set
        if -x in seen
            return true
        end
        # Add the current element to the set
        push!(seen, x)
    end

    # Step 5: Return false if no pair found
    return false
end
```

This function should work as expected based on the provided docstring examples.
