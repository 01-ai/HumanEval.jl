Here's a solution to the `correct_bracketing` problem in Julia:

```julia
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    stack = []
    
    for bracket in brackets
        if bracket == '('
            push!(stack, bracket)
        elseif bracket == ')'
            if isempty(stack)
                return false
            else
                pop!(stack)
            end
        end
    end
    
    return isempty(stack)
end
```

Explanation:

1. We initialize an empty stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.

2. We iterate over each character `bracket` in the `brackets` string.

3. If the current `bracket` is an opening bracket '(', we push it onto the stack using `push!(stack, bracket)`. This helps us keep track of the opening brackets that need to be closed.

4. If the current `bracket` is a closing bracket ')', we check if the stack is empty using `isempty(stack)`. If the stack is empty, it means we encountered a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so we return `false` since the bracketing is incorrect.

5. If the stack is not empty when we encounter a closing bracket, we pop the top element from the stack using `pop!(stack)`. This removes the corresponding opening bracket from the stack.

6. After iterating through all the brackets, we check if the stack is empty using `isempty(stack)`. If the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so we return `true`. Otherwise, if there are remaining opening brackets in the stack, we return `false` since the bracketing is incorrect.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `brackets` string, as we iterate through each character once. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, as the stack can grow up to the size of the input string if all the brackets are opening brackets.

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
julia> correct_bracketing("()")
false

julia> correct_bracketing("()()")
true

julia> correct_bracketing("((())())")
true

julia> correct_bracketing(")(())")
false
```

The function correctly returns the expected results for each example.
