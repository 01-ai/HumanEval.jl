Here is the Julia implementation of the function based on the provided docstring:

```julia
function add_even_eles_at_odd_inds(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:2:length(xs)
        if xs[i] % 2 == 0
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates over the elements of the input vector `xs` with a step of 2 (i.e., it only considers elements at odd indices), checks if the element at the current index is even, and if it is, adds it to the `sum` variable. Finally, it returns the `sum`.
