Here's a Julia function that implements the described behavior:

```julia
function sum_squares(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    result = 0
    for (index, x) in enumerate(xs)
        if index % 12 == 0  # Multiple of both 3 and 4
            result += x^3
        elseif index % 3 == 0
            result += x^2
        elseif index % 4 == 0
            result += x^3
        else
            result += x
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function does the following:

1. It initializes a `result` variable to 0, which will store the sum of the modified entries.

2. It iterates through the input vector `xs` using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each entry.

3. For each entry:
   - If the index is a multiple of both 3 and 4 (i.e., multiple of 12), it cubes the value (as per the rule for multiples of 4).
   - If the index is a multiple of 3 (but not 4), it squares the value.
   - If the index is a multiple of 4 (but not 3), it cubes the value.
   - For all other indices, it leaves the value unchanged.

4. It adds the modified (or unmodified) value to the `result`.

5. After processing all entries, it returns the final sum.

This implementation handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description:
- It squares entries at indices that are multiples of 3.
- It cubes entries at indices that are multiples of 4 (but not 3).
- It leaves other entries unchanged.
- It works for empty lists (returning 0).
- It works with negative numbers.

You can test it with the provided examples:

```julia
println(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 12
println(sum_squares(Int[]))  # Output: 0
println(sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]))  # Output: -8
```

These should produce the expected outputs as shown in the example doctest.
