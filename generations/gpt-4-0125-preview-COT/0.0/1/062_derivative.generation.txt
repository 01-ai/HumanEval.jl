### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize an empty vector** to store the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.
2. **Iterate through the input vector `xs`**, skipping the first element since its derivative will always be 0 (it's the constant term).
3. **For each coefficient** in the input vector (except the first one):
    - Calculate the derivative of that term. This is done by multiplying the coefficient by its index (which represents the power of x for that term).
    - Append the result to the vector initialized in step 1.
4. **Return the vector** containing the coefficients of the derivative polynomial.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function derivative(xs::Vector)::Vector
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty vector for the derivative coefficients
    derivative_coeffs = Vector{Int64}()
    
    # Step 2 & 3: Iterate through xs, skipping the first element
    for (index, coeff) in enumerate(xs)
        if index > 1  # Skip the first element
            # Calculate the derivative and append to the derivative_coeffs vector
            push!(derivative_coeffs, coeff * (index - 1))
        end
    end
    
    # Step 4: Return the derivative coefficients vector
    return derivative_coeffs
end
```

This function works by leveraging the fact that the derivative of \(a_n x^n\) is \(n \cdot a_n x^{n-1}\), and it applies this rule to each term of the polynomial represented by the input vector `xs`, except for the constant term (which is the first element of the vector and whose derivative is 0).
