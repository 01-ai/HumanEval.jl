To implement the `words_in_sentence` function, we need to follow these steps:

1. Define a helper function to check if a number is prime.
2. Split the sentence into words.
3. Filter the words based on the length being a prime number.
4. Join the filtered words back into a string with spaces.

Here's the Julia code for the function:

```julia
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
function is_prime(n::Int)::Bool
    if n <= 1
        return false
    end
    for i in 2:sqrt(n)
        if n % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end

# Main function to filter words with prime length
function words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = split(sentence)
    
    # Filter words where the length is a prime number
    prime_length_words = filter(word -> is_prime(length(word)), words)
    
    # Join the filtered words back into a string
    return join(prime_length_words, " ")
end

# Examples
println(words_in_sentence("This is a test")) # Output: "is"
println(words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming")) # Output: "go for"
```

This code defines the `words_in_sentence` function as specified in the doc string, along with a helper function `is_prime` to check for prime numbers. The examples at the end demonstrate the usage of the function.
