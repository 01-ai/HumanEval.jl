# Outline

1. First, we need to find the minimum and maximum values in the input vector.
2. Then, we calculate the range of the input data, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum.
3. Next, we create a new empty vector to store the rescaled numbers.
4. We iterate over the input vector and for each number, we subtract the minimum, divide by the range, and store the result in the new vector.
5. Finally, we return the new vector with the rescaled numbers.

# Code

```julia
function rescale_to_unit(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Vector{Float64}
    # Find the minimum and maximum values
    min_value = minimum(numbers)
    max_value = maximum(numbers)

    # Calculate the range of the input data
    range_value = max_value - min_value

    # Create a new vector to store the rescaled numbers
    rescaled_numbers = similar(numbers)

    # Iterate over the input vector and rescale each number
    for i in eachindex(numbers)
        rescaled_numbers[i] = (numbers[i] - min_value) / range_value
    end

    # Return the vector with the rescaled numbers
    return rescaled_numbers
end
```
