Here is a Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector)::Int
    counts = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for num in numbers
        counts[num] = get(counts, num, 0) + 1
    end
    max_num = -1
    for (num, count) in counts
        if num == count
            max_num = max(max_num, num)
        end
    end
    return max_num
end
```

This function first counts the frequency of each number in the input list using a dictionary. Then it iterates over the dictionary and checks if the number is equal to its frequency. If it is, it updates the maximum number if the number is greater than the current maximum. If no such number is found, it returns -1.
