Here is the implementation of the `fruit_distribution` function in Julia:

```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Extract the number of apples and oranges from the string
    apples = parse(Int, match(r"(\d+) apples", s).captures[1])
    oranges = parse(Int, match(r"(\d+) oranges", s).captures[1])
    
    # Calculate the number of mango fruits
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges
    
    return mangoes
end
```

This function extracts the number of apples and oranges from the input string using regular expressions, and then calculates the number of mango fruits by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits. Finally, it returns the number of mangoes.
