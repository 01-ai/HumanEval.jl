To solve this problem, we can write a function that checks if a number is prime or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We can check this by iterating through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number and checking if the given number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is, then the number is not prime.

Here is the step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Check if the given number is less than 2. If it is, return false because the number is either 0 or 1 which are not prime numbers.
2. Iterate through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number.
3. For each number, check if the given number is divisible by it. If it is, return false because the number is not prime.
4. If the given number is not divisible by any of the numbers, return true because the number is prime.

Here is the Julia code for the function:

```julia
function is_prime(n::Int)
    # Check if the number is less than 2
    if n < 2
        return false
    end

    # Iterate through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number
    for i in 2:sqrt(n)
        # Check if the given number is divisible by the current number
        if n % i == 0
            # If it is, return false because the number is not prime
            return false
        end
    end

    # If the given number is not divisible by any of the numbers, return true because the number is prime
    return true
end
```

This function should work correctly for all positive integers.
