To implement the `make_a_pile` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty vector `pile` to store the number of stones in each level.
2. Start with the first level having `n` stones and add it to `pile`.
3. For each subsequent level, calculate the number of stones by adding 2 to the previous level's number of stones.
4. Repeat step 3 until we have `n` levels in the pile.
5. Return the `pile` vector.

Now, let's write the code for the `make_a_pile` function:

```julia
function make_a_pile(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Step 1: Initialize the pile vector
    pile = Vector{Int}(undef, n)
    
    # Step 2: Add the first level to the pile
    pile[1] = n
    
    # Step 3 and 4: Calculate the number of stones for each subsequent level
    for i in 2:n
        pile[i] = pile[i-1] + 2
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return the pile vector
    return pile
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided example:

```julia
julia> make_a_pile(3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 5
 7
```

This should produce the expected output.
