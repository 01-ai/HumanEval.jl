Here's a solution to the problem in Julia:

```julia
function is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int)::Bool
    # Check if n is less than 8
    if n < 8
        return false
    end

    # Check if n is odd
    if n % 2 != 0
        return false
    end

    # Check if n can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers
    for a in 2:2:n-6
        for b in a:2:n-4-a
            for c in b:2:n-2-a-b
                d = n - a - b - c
                if d % 2 == 0 && d >= c
                    return true
                end
            end
        end
    end

    return false
end
```

Explanation:
1. We first check if the given number `n` is less than 8. If it is, we know that it cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, so we return `false`.

2. Next, we check if `n` is odd. If it is, we know that it cannot be written as the sum of even numbers, so we return `false`.

3. If `n` is even and greater than or equal to 8, we proceed to check if it can be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.

4. We use nested loops to generate all possible combinations of four even numbers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that sum up to `n`.
   - The outer loop iterates over `a` from 2 to `n-6` in steps of 2.
   - The middle loop iterates over `b` from `a` to `n-4-a` in steps of 2.
   - The inner loop iterates over `c` from `b` to `n-2-a-b` in steps of 2.
   - We calculate `d` as `n - a - b - c`.

5. If we find a combination where `d` is even and greater than or equal to `c`, it means we have found a valid combination of four positive even numbers that sum up to `n`, so we return `true`.

6. If we finish all the loops without finding a valid combination, it means `n` cannot be written as the sum of 4 positive even numbers, so we return `false`.

The code uses the `::Int` and `::Bool` type annotations to specify the input and output types of the function, respectively.

You can test the function with the examples you provided:

```jldoctest
julia> is_equal_to_sum_even(4)
false

julia> is_equal_to_sum_even(6)
false

julia> is_equal_to_sum_even(8)
true
```

The function will return `true` if the given number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, and `false` otherwise.
