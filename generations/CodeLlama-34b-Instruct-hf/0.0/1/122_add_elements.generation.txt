  Here's one way to implement the `add_elements` function in Julia:
```
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    # Check if the input is valid
    if length(xs) == 0 || k < 1 || k > length(xs)
        throw(ArgumentError("Invalid input"))
    end

    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0

    # Iterate over the first k elements of xs
    for i in 1:k
        # Check if the current element has at most two digits
        if length(string(xs[i])) <= 2
            # Add the element to the sum
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end

    return sum
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The function takes two arguments: `xs`, a vector of integers, and `k`, an integer.
2. The function checks if the input is valid. If the length of `xs` is 0, `k` is less than 1, or `k` is greater than the length of `xs`, an `ArgumentError` is thrown.
3. The function initializes the sum to 0.
4. The function iterates over the first `k` elements of `xs`.
5. For each element, the function checks if the element has at most two digits. If it does, the element is added to the sum.
6. The function returns the sum.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
julia> add_elements([111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4)
24
```
This returns the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first 4 elements of the input array, which is 24.
