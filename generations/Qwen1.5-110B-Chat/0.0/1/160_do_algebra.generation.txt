```julia
function do_algebra(operator::Vector{String}, operand::Vector{Int})
    # Mapping string operators to Julia's equivalent operators
    op_map = Dict("+"=>+, "-"=>-, "*"=>*, "รท"=>รท, "^"=>^)
    
    # Initialize the result with the first operand
    result = operand[1]
    
    # Apply the operators in sequence
    for i in 1:length(operator)
        result = op_map[operator[i]](result, operand[i+1])
    end
    
    return result
end
```
This function `do_algebra` follows the given specifications by iterating through the `operator` vector, applying each operation to the accumulated result and the next value from `operand`. It uses a dictionary `op_map` to convert the string representations of the operations into Julia's corresponding functions.
