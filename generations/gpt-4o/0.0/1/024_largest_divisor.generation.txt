Sure, here is the implementation of the `largest_divisor` function in Julia:

```julia
function largest_divisor(n::Int)::Int
    for i in (n-1):-1:1
        if n % i == 0
            return i
        end
    end
    return 1  # This line is theoretically unreachable since 1 is always a divisor of any n > 1
end
```

This function iterates from `n-1` down to `1` and returns the first number that divides `n` evenly. The largest divisor smaller than `n` will be found in this way. 

Here is how it works with the example provided:

```julia
julia> largest_divisor(15)
5
```
