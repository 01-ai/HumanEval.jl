```julia
function pluck(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Initialize variables to store the smallest even value and its index
    smallest_even = typemax(Int)
    index = -1

    # Iterate through the array to find the smallest even value and its index
    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        if x % 2 == 0 && x < smallest_even
            smallest_even = x
            index = i
        end
    end

    # Check if an even value was found
    if index == -1
        return Int[]
    else
        return [smallest_even, index]
    end
end
```

This Julia function `pluck` iterates through the given vector of integers to find the smallest even value along with its index. If such a value is found, it returns a vector containing the value and its index. If no even values are found or the input vector is empty, it returns an empty vector.
