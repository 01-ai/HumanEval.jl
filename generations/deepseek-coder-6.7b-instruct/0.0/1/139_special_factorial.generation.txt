Here is the Julia function that calculates the special factorial of a given number:

```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    if n == 0
        return 1
    else
        result = BigInt(1)
        for i in 1:n
            result *= factorial(i)
        end
        return result
    end
end
```

This function uses a loop to calculate the factorial of each number from 1 to n and multiplies them together. The factorial function is used to calculate the factorial of a number. The result is returned as a BigInt to handle large numbers. If n is 0, the function returns 1 as the special factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.
