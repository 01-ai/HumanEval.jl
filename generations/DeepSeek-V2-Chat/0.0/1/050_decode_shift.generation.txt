```julia
"""
Returns encoded string by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet.
"""
function encode_shift(s::String)::String
    join(((x - 'a' + 5 + 26) % 26 + 'a' for x in s))
end

"""
Takes as input string encoded with `encode_shift` function. Returns decoded string.
"""
function decode_shift(encoded_s::String)::String
    join(((x - 'a' - 5 + 26) % 26 + 'a' for x in encoded_s))
end
```

This implementation includes both the `encode_shift` and `decode_shift` functions. The `decode_shift` function reverses the encoding process by shifting each character back by 5 positions in the alphabet. The modulo operation ensures that the character remains within the bounds of the alphabet.
