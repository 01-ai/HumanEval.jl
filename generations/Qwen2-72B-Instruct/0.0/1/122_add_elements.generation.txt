```julia
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0

    # Iterate over the first k elements of xs
    for i in 1:k
        # Check if the current element has at most two digits
        if xs[i] >= -99 && xs[i] <= 99
            # Add the element to the sum
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end

    # Return the sum
    return sum
end
```
This function iterates over the first `k` elements of the input vector `xs`, checks if the current element has at most two digits (i.e., it is in the range `-99` to `99`), and if so, adds it to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.
