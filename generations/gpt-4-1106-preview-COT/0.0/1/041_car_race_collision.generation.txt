To implement the `car_race_collision` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Understand the problem:
   - We have `n` cars moving from left to right and `n` cars moving from right to left.
   - All cars move at the same speed and start far apart from each other.
   - A collision occurs when a car moving left to right meets a car moving right to left.
   - After a collision, cars continue moving in their original direction without any change in speed.
   - We need to calculate the total number of collisions that will occur.

2. Realize that since all cars move at the same speed and are equally spaced, every car moving left to right will eventually collide with every car moving right to left.

3. Calculate the total number of collisions:
   - Since each of the `n` cars moving left to right will collide with each of the `n` cars moving right to left, the total number of collisions will be `n * n`.

4. Implement the function:
   - The function will take an integer `n` as input and return an integer representing the total number of collisions.

5. Return the result.

Now, let's write the code for the `car_race_collision` function based on the above outline.
