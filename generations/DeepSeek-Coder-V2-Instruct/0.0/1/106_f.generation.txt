 Here's the implementation of the function `f` in Julia:

```julia
function f(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    result = Vector{Int}(undef, n)
    for i in 1:n
        if iseven(i)
            result[i] = factorial(i)
        else
            result[i] = sum(1:i)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function initializes an array of size `n` and then iterates over each index from 1 to `n`. For each index `i`, it checks if `i` is even. If it is, it calculates the factorial of `i` and stores it in the array. If `i` is odd, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` and stores it in the array. Finally, it returns the array.
