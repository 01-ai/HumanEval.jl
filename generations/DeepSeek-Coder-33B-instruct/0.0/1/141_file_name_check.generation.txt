Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function file_name_check(file_name::String)::String
    # Check if the file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    if count('.', file_name) != 1
        return "No"
    end

    # Split the file's name into two parts: before and after the dot
    parts = split(file_name, '.')

    # Check if the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter
    if isempty(parts[1]) || !isletter(parts[1][1])
        return "No"
    end

    # Check if the substring after the dot is one of these: ["txt", "exe", "dll"]
    if !(parts[2] in ["txt", "exe", "dll"])
        return "No"
    end

    # Check if there are not more than three digits in the file's name
    if count(isdigit, file_name) > 3
        return "No"
    end

    return "Yes"
end
```

This function works by first checking if the file's name contains exactly one dot '.'. If it does not, it returns "No". Then it splits the file's name into two parts: before and after the dot. It checks if the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter. If it is not, it returns "No". Then it checks if the substring after the dot is one of these: ["txt", "exe", "dll"]. If it is not, it returns "No". Finally, it checks if there are not more than three digits in the file's name. If there are, it returns "No". If all these checks pass, it returns "Yes".
