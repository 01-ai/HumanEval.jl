To solve this problem, we will iterate over each character in the string. If the character is a letter, we will reverse its case. If the character is not a letter, we will keep it as it is. If the string contains no letters, we will reverse the string.

Here is the step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Initialize an empty string `result` to store the resulted string.
2. Iterate over each character `c` in the string `s`.
3. If `c` is a letter, reverse its case and append it to `result`.
4. If `c` is not a letter, keep it as it is and append it to `result`.
5. After iterating over all characters in `s`, check if `result` is empty. If it is, reverse `s` and return it. Otherwise, return `result`.

Here is the Julia code for the function:

```julia
function reverse_string(s::String)::String
    result = ""
    for c in s
        if isletter(c)
            append!(result, c == lowercase(c) ? uppercase(c) : lowercase(c))
        else
            append!(result, c)
        end
    end
    return isempty(result) ? reverse(s) : result
end
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the string `s`. If the character is a letter, it reverses its case and appends it to `result`. If the character is not a letter, it keeps it as it is and appends it to `result`. After iterating over all characters in `s`, it checks if `result` is empty. If it is, it reverses `s` and returns it. Otherwise, it returns `result`.
