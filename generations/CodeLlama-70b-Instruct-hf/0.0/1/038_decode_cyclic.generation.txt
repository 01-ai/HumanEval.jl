```julia
function decode_cyclic(s::String)::String
    join((length(x) == 3 ? x[3] * x[1] * x[2] : x for x in Iterators.partition(s, 3)))
end
```

This function decodes the string encoded with the `encode_cyclic` function. It iterates through the string in groups of three characters and rearranges the characters in each group to their original positions.
