Here is the Julia function based on the given doc string:

```julia
function strlen(x::String)::Int
    return length(x)
end
```

This function takes a string as input and returns the length of the string. The `length` function in Julia returns the number of characters in a string.

You can test this function with the following code:

```julia
println(strlen("")) # should print 0
println(strlen("abc")) # should print 3
```
