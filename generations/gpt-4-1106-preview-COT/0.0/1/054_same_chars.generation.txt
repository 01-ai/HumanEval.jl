### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Define the function `same_chars` that takes two string arguments `s0` and `s1`.
2. Convert both strings `s0` and `s1` into sets of characters to eliminate duplicates and to make comparison order-independent.
3. Compare the sets of characters from both strings.
4. Return `true` if the sets are equal, indicating that both strings contain the same characters (ignoring frequency and order).
5. Return `false` otherwise.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function same_chars(s0::String, s1::String)::Bool
    # Step 2: Convert strings to sets of characters
    set_s0 = Set(s0)
    set_s1 = Set(s1)
    
    # Step 3 and 4: Compare the sets and return the result
    return set_s0 == set_s1
end
```

Now, let's implement the function in Julia.
