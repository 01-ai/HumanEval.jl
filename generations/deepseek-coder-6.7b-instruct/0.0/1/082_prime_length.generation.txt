Here is a Julia function that implements the `prime_length` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function prime_length(s::String)::Bool
    len = length(s)
    if len <= 1
        return false
    end
    for i in 2:isqrt(len)
        if len % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

This function first checks if the length of the string `s` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function immediately returns `false`, because the length of a string cannot be less than or equal to 1.

Then, the function checks if `len` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `len`. If `len` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `false`, because the length of a string cannot be divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

If `len` is not divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to the square root of `len`, the function returns `true`, because the length of a string can only be divisible by 1 and itself, and no other numbers.

The `isqrt` function is used to calculate the integer square root of a number, which is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the number.
