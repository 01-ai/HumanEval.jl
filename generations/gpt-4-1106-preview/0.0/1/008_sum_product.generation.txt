Certainly! Below is the Julia function `sum_product` that takes a vector of integers and returns a tuple with the sum and product of all the integers in the list:

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    # Initialize sum to 0 and product to 1
    sum = 0
    product = 1

    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for number in numbers
        sum += number
        product *= number
    end

    # Return the sum and product as a tuple
    return (sum, product)
end

# Examples
println(sum_product(Int[])) # Output: (0, 1)
println(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])) # Output: (10, 24)
```

You can copy and paste this function into your Julia environment to use it. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the list of numbers, updating the sum and product accordingly. If the list is empty, the initial values of sum as 0 and product as 1 are returned.
