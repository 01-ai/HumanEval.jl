Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function count_nums(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    count = 0
    for x in xs
        if sum(digits(abs(x))) > 0
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function works by iterating over each element in the input vector `xs`. For each element, it calculates the sum of its digits using the `digits` function and the `abs` function to ensure that negative numbers are handled correctly. If the sum of the digits is greater than 0, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns the count.
