  Here's one way to implement the `odd_count` function in Julia:
```
function odd_count(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    result = Vector{String}()
    for x in xs
        count = 0
        for c in x
            if c % 2 == 1
                count += 1
            end
        end
        push!(result, "the number of odd elements in the string $count of the input.")
    end
    return result
end
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. The function takes a vector of strings as input, and returns a vector of strings as output.
2. It iterates over each string in the input vector using a `for` loop.
3. For each string, it initializes a counter `count` to 0.
4. It then iterates over each character in the string using a nested `for` loop.
5. For each character, it checks if it is odd by using the modulo operator `%`. If the character is odd, it increments the `count` variable.
6. After iterating over all the characters in the string, it pushes a new string to the output vector that contains the number of odd elements in the string.
7. The function returns the output vector.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
julia> odd_count(["1234567", "3", "11111111"])
3-element Vector{String}:
 "the number of odd elements in the string 4 of the input."
 "the number of odd elements in the string 1 of the input."
 "the number of odd elements in the string 8 of the input."
```
