Here's the implementation of the `fizz_buzz` function in Julia:

```julia
function fizz_buzz(n::Int)
    count = 0
    for i in 1:n-1
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0
            count += count_sevens(i)
        end
    end
    return count
end

function count_sevens(num::Int)
    count = 0
    for digit in string(num)
        if digit == '7'
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function `fizz_buzz` iterates through all numbers less than `n` and checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13. If they are, it counts the number of sevens in those numbers using the helper function `count_sevens`. The `count_sevens` function converts the number to a string and iterates through each character, counting the occurrences of '7'.
