To implement the `sum_product` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `sum_product` that takes a vector of integers as an argument.
2. Initialize two variables, `sum` and `product`, with initial values of 0 and 1, respectively.
3. Iterate over each element in the vector.
4. For each element, add it to the `sum` and multiply it with the `product`.
5. After the loop, return a tuple containing the `sum` and `product`.

Now, let's write the code for the function:

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    # Step 2: Initialize sum and product
    sum = 0
    product = 1

    # Step 3: Iterate over each element in the vector
    for number in numbers
        # Step 4: Update sum and product
        sum += number
        product *= number
    end

    # Step 5: Return the tuple with sum and product
    return (sum, product)
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly:

```julia
# Test with an empty vector
println(sum_product(Int[])) # Expected output: (0, 1)

# Test with a vector containing numbers
println(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])) # Expected output: (10, 24)
```

This function should now correctly compute the sum and product of the elements in the given vector of integers.
