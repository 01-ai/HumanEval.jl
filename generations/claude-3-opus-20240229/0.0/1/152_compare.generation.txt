To solve this problem, you can use the `abs` function in Julia to calculate the absolute difference between each guess and the corresponding score. Here's the solution:

```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    return [abs(game[i] - guess[i]) for i in 1:length(game)]
end
```

Explanation:
1. The function `compare` takes two vectors `game` and `guess` of type `Vector{Int}` as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of `game` and `guess` simultaneously.
3. For each index `i`, it calculates the absolute difference between `game[i]` and `guess[i]` using the `abs` function.
4. The resulting absolute differences are collected into a new vector, which is returned as the output.

The function returns a vector of the same length as `game` and `guess`, where each element represents the absolute difference between the corresponding elements in `game` and `guess`.

Here are the example test cases and their results:

```jldoctest
julia> compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2])
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 0
 0
 0
 3
 3

julia> compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2])
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 4
 1
 0
 0
 6
```

The solution uses a concise and efficient list comprehension to calculate the absolute differences between the elements of `game` and `guess`. It returns the expected output for the given test cases.
