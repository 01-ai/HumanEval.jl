Here is a Julia function that implements the logic described in the problem:

```julia
function match_parens(lst::Vector{String})::String
    # Count the number of open and close parentheses in each string
    open_count_1, close_count_1 = count_parens(lst[1])
    open_count_2, close_count_2 = count_parens(lst[2])

    # If the number of open parentheses in the first string is less than the number of close parentheses in the second string,
    # it is impossible to make a good string.
    if open_count_1 < close_count_2
        return "No"
    end

    # If the number of close parentheses in the first string is less than the number of open parentheses in the second string,
    # it is impossible to make a good string.
    if close_count_1 < open_count_2
        return "No"
    end

    # If the number of open parentheses in the first string is greater than the number of close parentheses in the second string,
    # we can add the remaining open parentheses from the first string to the end of the second string.
    if open_count_1 > close_count_2
        lst[2] *= repeat(")", open_count_1 - close_count_2)
    end

    # If the number of close parentheses in the first string is greater than the number of open parentheses in the second string,
    # we can add the remaining close parentheses from the first string to the end of the second string.
    if close_count_1 > open_count_2
        lst[2] *= repeat("(", close_count_1 - open_count_2)
    end

    # Concatenate the two strings
    result = lst[1] * lst[2]

    # Check if the resulting string is good
    if is_good(result)
        return "Yes"
    else
        return "No"
    end
end

# Helper function to count the number of open and close parentheses in a string
function count_parens(s::String)
    open_count = count(c -> c == '(', s)
    close_count = count(c -> c == ')', s)
    return open_count, close_count
end

# Helper function to check if a string is good
function is_good(s::String)
    count = 0
    for c in s
        if c == '('
            count += 1
        elseif c == ')'
            count -= 1
            if count < 0
                return false
            end
        end
    end
    return count == 0
end
```

This function first counts the number of open and close parentheses in each string. Then it checks if it is possible to make a good string by adding parentheses to the second string. If it is possible, it concatenates the two strings and checks if the resulting string is good. If it is good, it returns "Yes"; otherwise, it returns "No".
