```julia
function bf(planet1::String, planet2::String)::NTuple
    # Check if the input planets are valid
    valid_planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    if planet1 ∉ valid_planets || planet2 ∉ valid_planets
        return ()
    end

    # Sort the planets by their distance from the sun
    sorted_planets = sort(valid_planets, by=x -> parse(Float64, replace(x, " " => "")))

    # Find the indices of the input planets in the sorted list
    planet1_index = findfirst(x -> x == planet1, sorted_planets)
    planet2_index = findfirst(x -> x == planet2, sorted_planets)

    # Calculate the range of planets between the two input planets
    start_index = min(planet1_index, planet2_index)
    end_index = max(planet1_index, planet2_index)

    # Return the planets in the range
    return tuple(sorted_planets[start_index:end_index])
end
```

This function first checks if the input planets are valid by comparing them to a list of known planets. If either `planet1` or `planet2` is not a valid planet name, the function returns an empty tuple.

If both `planet1` and `planet2` are valid, the function sorts the list of planets by their distance from the Sun. It then finds the indices of the input planets in the sorted list and calculates the range of planets between them. Finally, it returns a tuple containing all the planets in that range, sorted by the proximity to the Sun.
