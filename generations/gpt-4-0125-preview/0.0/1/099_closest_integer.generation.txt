To implement the `closest_integer` function as described, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the input string to a floating-point number.
2. Check if the decimal part of the number is exactly 0.5 or -0.5 (equidistant case). If so, round it away from zero.
3. In all other cases, use the standard rounding mechanism to find the closest integer.

Here's how the implementation might look in Julia:

```julia
function closest_integer(value::String)::Int
    # Convert the input string to a floating-point number
    num = parse(Float64, value)
    
    # Extract the fractional part of the number
    fractional_part = abs(num) - floor(abs(num))
    
    # Check if the number is equidistant from two integers
    if fractional_part == 0.5
        # Round away from zero
        if num > 0
            return ceil(num)
        else
            return floor(num)
        end
    else
        # Use standard rounding for all other cases
        return round(Int, num)
    end
end
```

This function first converts the input string to a `Float64` number. It then checks if the fractional part of the absolute value of the number is exactly 0.5, indicating that it is equidistant from two integers. If so, it rounds the number away from zero by using `ceil` for positive numbers and `floor` for negative numbers. For all other cases, it uses the standard `round` function to round to the nearest integer.
