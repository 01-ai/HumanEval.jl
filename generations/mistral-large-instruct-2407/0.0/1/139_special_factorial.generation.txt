 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `special_factorial` function in Julia based on the given doc string:

```julia
"""
    special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt

The Brazilian factorial is defined as: brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! *
(n-2)! * ... * 1! where n > 0

The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
factorial of this integer.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> special_factorial(4)
288
```
"""
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    result = BigInt(1)
    for i in 1:n
        result *= factorial(BigInt(i))
    end
    return result
end

# Example usage
println(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
```

This function calculates the Brazilian factorial by iterating from 1 to `n`, computing the factorial of each number, and multiplying the results together. The use of `BigInt` ensures that the function can handle large numbers without overflow.
