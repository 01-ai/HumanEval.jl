Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    binary = string(decimal, base = 2)
    return "db" * binary * "db"
end
```

This function uses the `string` function with `base = 2` to convert the decimal number to a binary string. Then it concatenates the "db" at the beginning and at the end of the binary string.

Let's test the function with the example:

```julia
println(decimal_to_binary(15))  # Output: "db1111db"
```
