Sure, here is the Julia function that implements the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients:

```julia
function derivative(xs::Vector)::Vector
    # Calculate the derivative of a polynomial given its coefficients
    # The derivative of x^n is n*x^(n-1), so we multiply each coefficient by its index and decrease the index by 1
    # The constant term (xs[1]) has a derivative of 0, so we start from the second element
    return [i * xs[i] for i in 2:length(xs)]
end
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new vector where each element is the corresponding coefficient from `xs` multiplied by its index. The index starts from 2 because the derivative of the constant term (the first element in `xs`) is 0, so we ignore it. The result is a new vector that represents the coefficients of the derivative of the original polynomial.
