Certainly! Below is the Julia function `is_bored` that implements the functionality described in the doc string:

```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences based on the delimiters
    sentences = split(s, r"[.?!]")
    
    # Initialize boredom count
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Trim whitespace from the sentence
        trimmed_sentence = strip(sentence)
        
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I" followed by a space or the end of the sentence
        if startswith(trimmed_sentence, "I ") || trimmed_sentence == "I"
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end
    
    return boredom_count
end
```

You can test this function with the provided examples or any other string to count the number of boredoms as defined.
