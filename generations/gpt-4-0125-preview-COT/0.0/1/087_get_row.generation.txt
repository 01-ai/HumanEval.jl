### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize an empty list** to store the coordinates of the occurrences of `x`.
2. **Iterate through the given 2D list (`xs`)**, keeping track of the row index.
   - For each row, iterate through its elements, keeping track of the column index.
   - If the current element matches `x`, append the tuple `(row_index, column_index)` to the list of coordinates.
3. **Sort the list of coordinates** based on the requirements:
   - First, by row in ascending order.
   - Then, by column in descending order for coordinates within the same row.
4. **Return the sorted list of coordinates**.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function get_row(xs::Vector{Vector{Int}}, x::Int)::Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}}
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty list for coordinates
    coordinates = Tuple{Int, Int}[]

    # Step 2: Iterate through xs to find occurrences of x
    for (row_idx, row) in enumerate(xs)
        for (col_idx, value) in enumerate(row)
            if value == x
                push!(coordinates, (row_idx, col_idx))
            end
        end
    end

    # Step 3: Sort the coordinates
    # Sort by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order within the same row
    sort!(coordinates, by = t -> (t[1], -t[2]))

    # Step 4: Return the sorted list of coordinates
    return coordinates
end
```

This function follows the outlined steps to find and return the coordinates of `x` in the given 2D list, sorted according to the specified criteria.
