Here's an implementation of the `find_zero` function in Julia:

```julia
function find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})
    # Check if the number of coefficients is even
    if length(xs) % 2 != 0
        throw(ArgumentError("The number of coefficients must be even."))
    end
    
    # Check if the largest coefficient is non-zero
    if xs[end] == 0
        throw(ArgumentError("The largest coefficient must be non-zero."))
    end
    
    # Define the polynomial function using the given coefficients
    f(x) = poly(xs, x)
    
    # Find a zero of the polynomial using the bisection method
    a, b = -1.0, 1.0
    while b - a > 1e-8
        c = (a + b) / 2
        if f(a) * f(c) < 0
            b = c
        else
            a = c
        end
    end
    
    return (a + b) / 2
end
```

Explanation:

1. We start by checking if the number of coefficients in `xs` is even using the `length` function and the modulo operator `%`. If the number of coefficients is odd, we raise an `ArgumentError` with an appropriate message.

2. We also check if the largest coefficient (i.e., the last element of `xs`) is non-zero. If it is zero, we raise an `ArgumentError` with an appropriate message.

3. We define a local function `f` that represents the polynomial using the given coefficients `xs`. This function is created using the `poly` function you provided earlier.

4. To find a zero of the polynomial, we use the bisection method. We initialize two variables `a` and `b` to define the initial interval [-1, 1] within which we will search for a zero.

5. We start a loop that continues as long as the interval `[a, b]` is larger than a small threshold (in this case, 1e-8). Inside the loop:
   - We calculate the midpoint `c` of the interval `[a, b]`.
   - We evaluate the polynomial at `a` and `c` using the `f` function.
   - If the product of `f(a)` and `f(c)` is negative, it means the zero lies between `a` and `c`, so we update `b` to `c`.
   - Otherwise, the zero lies between `c` and `b`, so we update `a` to `c`.

6. After the loop ends, we have found an approximate zero of the polynomial within the specified tolerance. We return the midpoint of the final interval `[a, b]` as the result.

The bisection method guarantees convergence to a zero of the polynomial, assuming the polynomial has a zero within the initial interval [-1, 1]. The method works by repeatedly halving the interval and selecting the subinterval that contains the zero based on the signs of the polynomial evaluated at the endpoints.

Note: This implementation assumes that the polynomial has a zero within the interval [-1, 1]. If the zero lies outside this interval, the function may not converge or may return an incorrect result. You can modify the initial interval `[a, b]` based on your specific requirements.
