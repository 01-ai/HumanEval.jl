To implement the `double_the_difference` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Check if the input vector `xs` is empty. If it is, return 0 immediately.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of squares of odd numbers.
3. Iterate over each element in the vector `xs`.
4. For each element, check if it is an integer, non-negative, and odd.
5. If the element meets the criteria, square it and add it to the sum.
6. After the loop, return the sum.

Now, let's write the code for the function:
```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    # Step 1: Return 0 if the input vector is empty
    if isempty(xs)
        return 0
    end
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the sum of squares
    sum_of_squares = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate over each element in the vector
    for x in xs
        # Step 4: Check if the element is an integer, non-negative, and odd
        if isa(x, Integer) && x > 0 && isodd(x)
            # Step 5: Square the element and add it to the sum
            sum_of_squares += x^2
        end
    end
    
    # Step 6: Return the sum
    return sum_of_squares
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected:
```julia
println(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]))  # Should output 10
println(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]))   # Should output 0
println(double_the_difference([9, -2]))       # Should output 81
println(double_the_difference([0]))           # Should output 0
```
Please note that the function name `double_the_difference` does not accurately describe the functionality as per the docstring. The function calculates the sum of squares of odd numbers, not doubling any difference. If the function name is a requirement, it should be used as given, but otherwise, it might be worth considering renaming the function to better reflect its purpose, such as `sum_of_squares_of_odd_numbers`.
