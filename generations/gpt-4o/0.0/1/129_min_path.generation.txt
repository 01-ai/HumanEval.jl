To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest path of length `k` in a grid. We can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from each cell in the grid. During the search, we will keep track of the lexicographically smallest path found.

Here's the implementation of the `min_path` function in Julia:

```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = length(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right, down, left, up

    function in_bounds(x, y)
        return 1 <= x <= N && 1 <= y <= N
    end

    function dfs(x, y, path)
        if length(path) == k
            return path
        end

        min_path = nothing
        for (dx, dy) in directions
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if in_bounds(nx, ny)
                new_path = dfs(nx, ny, path * [grid[nx][ny]])
                if min_path === nothing || new_path < min_path
                    min_path = new_path
                end
            end
        end
        return min_path
    end

    min_path = nothing
    for i in 1:N
        for j in 1:N
            path = dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])
            if min_path === nothing || path < min_path
                min_path = path
            end
        end
    end

    return min_path
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **Grid and Directions**: We define the grid size `N` and possible movement directions (right, down, left, up).
2. **In-bounds Check**: A helper function `in_bounds` checks if a cell is within the grid boundaries.
3. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search starting from cell `(x, y)` and builds the path. If the path length reaches `k`, it returns the path.
4. **Main Loop**: We iterate over each cell in the grid, start a DFS from that cell, and keep track of the lexicographically smallest path found.

### Example Usage:
```julia
println(min_path([[
