Here is the Julia function that matches the provided docstring:
```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector)
    return filter(x -> x > 0, xs)
end
```
This function uses the built-in `filter` function to create a new vector that only includes the elements of the input vector `xs` that are greater than 0.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

* `filter` takes two arguments: a function and a collection (in this case, a vector).
* The function `x -> x > 0` is an anonymous function that takes a single argument `x` and returns `true` if `x` is greater than 0, and `false` otherwise.
* `filter` applies this function to each element of the input vector `xs`, and returns a new vector that only includes the elements for which the function returned `true`.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring:
```julia
julia> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 5
 6

julia> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
7-element Vector{Int64}:
   5
   3
   2
   3
   9
 123
   1
```
