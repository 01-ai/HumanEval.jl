Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    if isempty(numbers)
        return (0, 1)
    else
        sum_numbers = sum(numbers)
        product_numbers = prod(numbers)
        return (sum_numbers, product_numbers)
    end
end
```

This function first checks if the input vector is empty. If it is, it returns a tuple of 0 and 1. If it is not, it calculates the sum and product of the numbers in the vector and returns them as a tuple.
