### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Check for Empty String**: If the input string is empty, return an empty string immediately as it is already a palindrome.

2. **Identify Longest Palindromic Suffix**:
   - Start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning.
   - For each position, check if the substring from this position to the end is a palindrome.
   - The first such substring encountered will be the longest palindromic suffix because we are moving from the end towards the start.

3. **Construct Palindrome**:
   - Once the longest palindromic suffix is identified, find the prefix that comes before this suffix.
   - Reverse this prefix and append it to the end of the original string.
   - This ensures that the original string is extended minimally to form a palindrome.

4. **Return Result**: Return the newly formed palindrome string.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function palindrome_with_append(s::String)::String
    # Step 1: Check for empty string
    if isempty(s)
        return ""
    end

    n = length(s)
    # Convert string to array for easier manipulation
    s_array = collect(s)

    # Step 2: Identify longest palindromic suffix
    for i in 1:n
        # Check if the substring from i to n is a palindrome
        if s_array[i:end] == reverse(s_array[i:end])
            # Step 3: Construct palindrome
            # Find the prefix before the palindromic suffix
            prefix = s_array[1:i-1]
            # Append reverse of prefix to the original string
            return join(s_array) * join(reverse(prefix))
        end
    end

    # Fallback, in case no palindromic suffix is found, which shouldn't happen due to the logic
    return s
end
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps to ensure that the function `palindrome_with_append` efficiently finds and returns the shortest palindrome that can be formed by appending characters to the end of the given string.
