```julia
function rounded_avg(n::Int, m::Int)::Union{Int, String}
    if n > m
        return -1
    end
    avg = round(Int, (n + m) / 2)
    return string(bin(avg))
end
```

This Julia function `rounded_avg` takes two positive integers `n` and `m` as input. It first checks if `n` is greater than `m`, in which case it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the average of `n` and `m`, rounds it to the nearest integer, converts the result to binary, and returns the binary string. The function adheres to the specifications provided in the doc string.
