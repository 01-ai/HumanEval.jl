Here is the Julia function that implements the described behavior:

```julia
function rescale_to_unit(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Vector{Float64}
    min_val = minimum(numbers)
    max_val = maximum(numbers)
    return [(n - min_val) / (max_val - min_val) for n in numbers]
end
```

This function first calculates the minimum and maximum values of the input vector. Then it applies a linear transformation to each element of the vector, rescaling it to the range [0, 1] according to the formula `(n - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)`.
