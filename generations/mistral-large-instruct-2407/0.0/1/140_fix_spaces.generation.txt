 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `fix_spaces` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    fix_spaces(s::String)::String

Given a string text, replace all spaces in it with underscores, and if a string
has two or more consecutive spaces, then replace all consecutive spaces with -

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fix_spaces("Example")
"Example"

julia> fix_spaces("Example 1")
"Example_1"

julia> fix_spaces(" Example 2")
"_Example_2"

julia> fix_spaces(" Example   3")
"_Example-3"
```
"""
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # Replace two or more consecutive spaces with a single dash
    s = replace(s, r" {2,}" => "-")
    # Replace remaining single spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")
    return s
end

# Testing the function with the provided examples
println(fix_spaces("Example"))        # "Example"
println(fix_spaces("Example 1"))      # "Example_1"
println(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))     # "_Example_2"
println(fix_spaces(" Example   3"))   # "_Example-3"
```

This function first replaces two or more consecutive spaces with a single dash using a regular expression. Then, it replaces any remaining single spaces with underscores. The provided examples are also included as test cases to verify the function's correctness.
