```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    sorted_thirds = sort(filter((x, val) -> x % 3 == 0, enumerate(l)) do tuple
        tuple[2]
    end)
    
    result = copy(l)
    index = 1
    for (i, val) in sorted_thirds
        result[i] = val
        index += 1
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This function first filters out the elements at indices that are divisible by three and sorts these values. Then, it iterates over these sorted values and replaces the elements at their original indices in a copy of the input list, ensuring the rest of the list remains unchanged. The sorted elements at indices divisible by three are correctly placed back into the list, and the modified list is returned.
