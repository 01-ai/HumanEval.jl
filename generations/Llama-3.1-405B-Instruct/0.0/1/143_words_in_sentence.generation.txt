Here is a Julia function that implements the described behavior:
```julia
"""
    words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String

You are given a string representing a sentence, the sentence contains some words
separated by a space, and you have to return a string that contains the words
from the original sentence, whose lengths are prime numbers, the order of the
words in the new string should be the same as the original one.

Constraints:

    * 1 <= len(sentence) <= 100
    * sentence contains only letters

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> words_in_sentence("This is a test")
"is"

julia> words_in_sentence("lets go for swimming")
"go for"
```
"""
function words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String
    # Define a helper function to check if a number is prime
    is_prime(n::Int) = n > 1 && all(n % i != 0 for i in 2:isqrt(n))

    # Split the sentence into words
    words = split(sentence, ' ')

    # Filter the words whose lengths are prime numbers
    prime_words = filter(word -> is_prime(length(word)), words)

    # Join the prime words back into a sentence
    join(prime_words, ' ')
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We define a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. This function uses the property that a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
2. We split the input sentence into words using the `split` function.
3. We filter the words whose lengths are prime numbers using the `filter` function and the `is_prime` helper function.
4. We join the prime words back into a sentence using the `join` function.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring.
