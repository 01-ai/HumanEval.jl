To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the index of the minimum element in the array.
2. Check if the array is already sorted from this index to the end, and then from the beginning to this index (considering it as a circular array).
3. If it is sorted in this way, return true; otherwise, return false.

Here's the implementation in Julia:

```julia
function move_one_ball(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # If the array is empty or has only one element, it's already sorted
    if length(xs) <= 1
        return true
    end

    # Find the index of the minimum element
    min_index = argmin(xs)

    # Check if the array is sorted in circular manner
    n = length(xs)
    is_sorted = true

    # Check from min_index to the end
    for i in min_index:n-1
        if xs[i] > xs[i+1]
            is_sorted = false
            break
        end
    end

    # If still sorted, check from beginning to min_index
    if is_sorted && min_index > 1
        for i in 1:min_index-1
            if xs[i] < xs[i-1] || xs[i] < xs[n]
                is_sorted = false
                break
            end
        end
    end

    return is_sorted
end
```

This function works as follows:

1. If the array has 0 or 1 elements, it's already sorted, so we return `true`.
2. We find the index of the minimum element using `argmin`.
3. We then check if the array is sorted from this minimum index to the end.
4. If it is, we also check from the beginning of the array up to the minimum index, considering the array as circular (the last element should be smaller than the first element in this part).
5. If both parts are sorted, we return `true`, otherwise `false`.

This solution works because if it's possible to sort the array with right shift operations, the array must be already sorted in a circular manner, with the minimum element as the starting point of the sorted sequence.

You can test it with the examples provided:

```julia
println(move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))  # Should print: true
println(move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]))  # Should print: false
```

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we traverse the array at most twice.
