Here is a possible implementation of the `min_path` function in Julia:

```julia
using DataStructures

function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = length(grid)
    visited = falses(N, N)
    dists = PriorityQueue{Tuple{Int,Int,Int},Int}()
    enqueue!(dists, (grid[1][1], 0, 0), 1)
    prev = Dict{Tuple{Int,Int},Tuple{Int,Int}}()

    function neighbors(r, c)
        for dr in [-1, 0, 1], dc in [-1, 0, 1]
            if !(dr == 0 && dc == 0) && 1 <= r + dr <= N && 1 <= c + dc <= N
                yield(r + dr, c + dc)
            end
        end
    end

    while !isempty(dists)
        (val, d, (r, c)), _ = dequeue_pair!(dists)
        if d == k - 1
            path = Int[]
            rc = (r, c)
            for _ in 1:k
                push!(path, grid[rc[1]][rc[2]])
                rc = prev[rc]
            end
            return reverse(path)
        end
        for nr, nc in neighbors(r, c)
            if !visited[nr, nc]
                visited[nr, nc] = true
                enqueue!(dists, (grid[nr][nc], d + 1, (nr, nc)), grid[nr][nc])
                prev[(nr, nc)] = (r, c)
            end
        end
    end
end
```

This function uses a priority queue to store the cells to visit next, ordered by their value. It keeps track of the previous cell for each cell, so that the path can be reconstructed at the end. The `neighbors` function generates all neighboring cells of a given cell. The function iterates until it finds a path of length `k`, and then returns this path.
