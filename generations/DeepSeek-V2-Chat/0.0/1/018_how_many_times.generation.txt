Here's the implementation of the `how_many_times` function in Julia:

```julia
function how_many_times(s::String, sub_s::String)::Int
    count = 0
    len = length(sub_s)
    for i in 1:length(s)-len+1
        if s[i:i+len-1] == sub_s
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates through the string `s` and checks for occurrences of the substring `sub_s`, counting overlapping cases as well.
