### Step-by-Step Outline

1. Define a function named `concatenate` that takes one argument `xs`, which is a vector of strings (`Vector{String}`).
2. Inside the function, use a built-in Julia function or operator to concatenate all the strings in the vector into a single string.
3. Return the resulting string.

### Julia Code

```julia
"""
    concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String

Concatenate list of strings into a single string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> concatenate(String[])
""

julia> concatenate(["a", "b", "c"])
"abc"
```
"""
function concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String
    # Concatenate all strings in the vector
    return join(xs)
end
```

This function uses the `join` function from Julia's standard library, which concatenates all elements of an array into a single string.
