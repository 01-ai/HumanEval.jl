    sort_third(l::Vector)

This function takes a list `l` and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to
`l` in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the
indicies that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the
corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
7-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 6
 3
 4
 8
 9
 2
```

To implement the `sort_third` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty array to store the elements at indices divisible by three.
2. Iterate through the input list `l` and for each element at an index `i` (0-based indexing):
   - If `(i + 1) % 3 == 0`, append the element to the array created in step 1.
3. Sort the array containing the elements at indices divisible by three.
4. Create a new list `l_prime` that will store the final result.
5. Iterate through the input list `l` again and for each element at an index `i` (0-based indexing):
   - If `(i + 1) % 3 == 0`, append the next element from the sorted array to `l_prime`.
   - Otherwise, append the current element from `l` to `l_prime`.
6. Return the list `l_prime`.

Now, let's write the code for the `sort_third` function in Julia.
