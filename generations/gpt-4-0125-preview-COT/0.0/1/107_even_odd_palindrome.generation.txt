### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Define the function** `even_odd_palindrome(n::Int)` that takes a positive integer `n` as input.

2. **Initialize two counters** for even and odd palindromes, respectively.

3. **Iterate through numbers from 1 to n** to check each number if it's a palindrome.

    a. **Check if a number is a palindrome** by converting it to a string, and then comparing the string with its reverse. If they are equal, the number is a palindrome.
    
    b. **Determine if the palindrome is even or odd** by checking the remainder when divided by 2. Increment the respective counter based on this.
    
4. **Return the tuple** containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function even_odd_palindrome(n::Int)::Tuple{Int, Int}
    # Initialize counters for even and odd palindromes
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through numbers from 1 to n
    for i in 1:n
        # Convert the number to a string and check if it's a palindrome
        if string(i) == reverse(string(i))
            # Check if the palindrome is even or odd and increment the respective counter
            if i % 2 == 0
                even_count += 1
            else
                odd_count += 1
            end
        end
    end
    
    # Return the tuple of even and odd palindrome counts
    return (even_count, odd_count)
end
```

This function iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, checks each number to determine if it is a palindrome, and then categorizes it as even or odd based on its value. Finally, it returns the counts of even and odd palindromes as a tuple.
