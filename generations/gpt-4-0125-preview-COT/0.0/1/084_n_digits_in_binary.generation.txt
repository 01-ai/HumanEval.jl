### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Convert the Integer to Binary**: Convert the given integer `N` to its binary representation. This can be done using the built-in Julia function `bin()` which converts an integer to a binary string.

2. **Sum the Digits of the Binary Representation**: Iterate through the binary string, converting each character to an integer and summing these integers. This will give the total sum of the digits in the binary representation.

3. **Convert the Sum to String**: Since the function is expected to return a string, convert the sum obtained in step 2 back to a string using the `string()` function.

4. **Return the Result**: Return the string representation of the sum.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function n_digits_in_binary(N::Int)::String
    # Step 1: Convert N to its binary representation
    binary_representation = bin(N)
    
    # Step 2: Sum the digits of the binary representation
    sum_of_digits = sum([parse(Int, char) for char in binary_representation])
    
    # Step 3: Convert the sum to a string
    sum_as_string = string(sum_of_digits)
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return sum_as_string
end
```

This function should work as expected for the given examples and constraints.
