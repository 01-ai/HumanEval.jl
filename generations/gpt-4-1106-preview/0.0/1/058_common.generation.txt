Certainly! Below is the Julia function `common` that takes two vectors `l1` and `l2` and returns a sorted vector of their unique common elements.

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    # Find the intersection of the two lists and convert it to a set to ensure uniqueness
    common_elements = intersect(Set(l1), Set(l2))
    
    # Convert the set back to a list and sort it
    sorted_common_elements = sort(collect(common_elements))
    
    return sorted_common_elements
end

# Examples
println(common([1, 4, 3, 34, 653, 2, 5], [5, 7, 1, 5, 9, 653, 121])) # Should print [1, 5, 653]
println(common([5, 3, 2, 8], [3, 2])) # Should print [2, 3]
```

You can copy and paste this function into your Julia environment to use it. The examples provided will also demonstrate how the function works.
