### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize a counter**: This will keep track of the total number of times the buckets are lowered into the wells.

2. **Iterate through each well (row) in the grid**:
   - For each well, calculate the total amount of water present. This can be done by summing up the values in the row since each `1` represents a unit of water.
   - Determine the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered for that particular well. This is done by dividing the total amount of water by the capacity of the bucket. If there is a remainder, it means an additional lowering of the bucket is needed to extract the remaining water.
   - Add the calculated number of lowerings for the current well to the total counter.

3. **Return the total counter** as the result, which represents the number of times the buckets need to be lowered to empty all the wells.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function max_fill(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, capacity::Int)::Int
    # Step 1: Initialize the counter
    total_lowerings = 0

    # Step 2: Iterate through each well in the grid
    for well in grid
        # Calculate the total amount of water in the current well
        total_water = sum(well)
        
        # Determine the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered for this well
        lowerings_for_well = div(total_water, capacity)
        
        # If there's a remainder, add one more lowering
        if total_water % capacity > 0
            lowerings_for_well += 1
        end
        
        # Add the number of lowerings for this well to the total counter
        total_lowerings += lowerings_for_well
    end

    # Step 3: Return the total number of lowerings
    return total_lowerings
end
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps to calculate the total number of times buckets need to be lowered to empty all the wells, given the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.
