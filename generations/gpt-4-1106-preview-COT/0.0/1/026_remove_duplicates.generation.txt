### Step-by-step Outline:

1. Initialize an empty `Vector{Int}` to store the unique elements.
2. Initialize an empty `Set{Int}` to keep track of the elements that have been seen.
3. Iterate through each element in the input `numbers` vector.
4. For each element, check if it is already in the set.
   - If it is not in the set, add it to both the set and the unique elements vector.
   - If it is in the set, continue to the next element without adding it to the unique elements vector.
5. Return the vector containing the unique elements.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function remove_duplicates(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    unique_elements = Vector{Int}()
    seen = Set{Int}()
    
    for number in numbers
        if !(number in seen)
            push!(seen, number)
            push!(unique_elements, number)
        end
    end
    
    return unique_elements
end
```

Now, let's implement the function in Julia.
