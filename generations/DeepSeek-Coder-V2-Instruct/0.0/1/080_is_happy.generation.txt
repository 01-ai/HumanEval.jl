 Here's the implementation of the `is_happy` function in Julia:

```julia
function is_happy(s::String)::Bool
    n = length(s)
    if n < 3
        return false
    end
    
    for i in 1:(n - 2)
        if s[i] == s[i + 1] || s[i] == s[i + 2] || s[i + 1] == s[i + 2]
            return false
        end
    end
    
    return true
end
```

This function checks if the string `s` has a length of at least 3. If not, it returns `false`. If the length is sufficient, it iterates through the string, checking each set of three consecutive characters to ensure they are all distinct. If any set of three characters is not distinct, it returns `false`. If all sets of three characters are distinct, it returns `true`.
