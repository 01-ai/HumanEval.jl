Certainly! Below is the Julia function `flip_case` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with each character's case flipped.

```julia
"""
    flip_case(s::String)::String

For a given string, flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> flip_case("Hello")
"hELLO"
```
"""
function flip_case(s::String)::String
    # Create an empty string to store the result
    result = ""
    
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for c in s
        # Check if the character is uppercase
        if isuppercase(c)
            # Convert to lowercase and append to result
            result *= lowercase(c)
        else
            # Convert to uppercase and append to result
            result *= uppercase(c)
        end
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This function iterates through each character in the input string. It checks if a character is uppercase using `isuppercase(c)`. If it is, the character is converted to lowercase using `lowercase(c)` and appended to the result string. If it's not uppercase (implying it's lowercase or a non-alphabetic character, which remains unchanged), it's converted to uppercase using `uppercase(c)` and appended to the result. Non-alphabetic characters are unaffected by `uppercase` and `lowercase` functions and are appended to the result as they are.
