# Outline

1. Merge the two input vectors into a single vector.
2. Use the `unique` function to remove duplicate elements.
3. Sort the resulting vector in ascending order.
4. Return the sorted vector of common elements.

# Code

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    # Merge the two input vectors into a single vector
    merged = [l1; l2]
    
    # Use the `unique` function to remove duplicate elements
    unique_merged = unique(merged)
    
    # Sort the resulting vector in ascending order
    sorted_unique_merged = sort(unique_merged)
    
    # Return the sorted vector of common elements
    return sorted_unique_merged
end
```
