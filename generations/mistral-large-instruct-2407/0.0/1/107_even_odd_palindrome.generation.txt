 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `even_odd_palindrome` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    even_odd_palindrome(n::Int)::Tuple{Int, Int}

Given a positive integer n, return a tuple that has the number of even and odd
integer palindromes that fall within the range(1, n), inclusive.

!!! note

     1. 1 <= n <= 10^3
     2. returned tuple has the number of even and odd integer palindromes respectively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> even_odd_palindrome(3) # palindrome are 1, 2, 3. one of them is even, and two of them are odd.
(1, 2)

julia> even_odd_palindrome(12) # Integer palindrome are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11. four of them are even, and 6 of them are odd.
(4, 6)
```
"""
function even_odd_palindrome(n::Int)::Tuple{Int, Int}
    function is_palindrome(x::Int)::Bool
        s = string(x)
        return s == reverse(s)
    end

    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0

    for i in 1:n
        if is_palindrome(i)
            if iseven(i)
                even_count += 1
            else
                odd_count += 1
            end
        end
    end

    return (even_count, odd_count)
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **Helper Function `is_palindrome`**: This function checks if a given integer is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it to its reverse.
2. **Main Function `even_odd_palindrome`**:
   - Initializes counters `even_count` and `odd_count` to zero.
   - Iterates through each integer from 1 to `n`.
   - For each integer, it checks if it is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function.
   - If it is a palindrome, it further checks if it is even or odd and increments the respective counter.
   - Finally, it returns a tuple containing the counts of even and odd palindromes.

This implementation ensures that the function works efficiently within the given constraints (1 <= n <= 10^3).
