Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    total_xs = sum(length, xs)
    total_ys = sum(length, ys)
    if total_xs < total_ys
        return xs
    elseif total_xs > total_ys
        return ys
    else
        return xs
    end
end
```
This function first calculates the total number of characters in each list by summing the lengths of all strings in the list. It then compares these totals and returns the list with the smaller total. If the totals are equal, it returns the first list.
