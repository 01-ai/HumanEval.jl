 Here's the implementation of the `correct_angle_bracketing` function in Julia:

```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets
        if char == '<'
            balance += 1
        elseif char == '>'
            balance -= 1
        end
        if balance < 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return balance == 0
end
```

This function iterates through each character in the input string. It maintains a `balance` counter that increments for each opening bracket `<` and decrements for each closing bracket `>`. If at any point the `balance` becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening ones up to that point, so the function returns `false`. If the loop completes and the `balance` is zero, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns `true`.
