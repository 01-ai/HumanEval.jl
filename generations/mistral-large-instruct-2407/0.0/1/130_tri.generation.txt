 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `tri` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    tri(n::Int)::Vector{Int}

Everyone knows Fibonacci sequence, it was studied deeply by mathematicians in
the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci
sequence. Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:

tri(1) = 1

tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.

tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.

For example:

tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2

tri(4) = 3

tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4) = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6

You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of
the first n numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tri(3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6
```
"""
function tri(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    if n <= 0
        return Int[]
    end

    # Initialize the result vector with zeros
    tribonacci = zeros(Int, n)

    # Base case
    tribonacci[1] = 1

    # Fill the vector according to the given rules
    for i in 2:n
        if iseven(i)
            tribonacci[i] = 1 + div(i, 2)
        else
            if i + 1 <= n
                tribonacci[i] = tribonacci[i - 1] + tribonacci[i - 2] + tribonacci[i + 1]
            else
                # Handle the case where i + 1 is out of bounds
                tribonacci[i] = tribonacci[i - 1] + tribonacci[i - 2] + (1 + div(i + 1, 2))
            end
        end
    end

    return tribonacci
end
```

This function computes the first `n` numbers of the Tribonacci sequence as defined by the given rules. The function handles both even and odd cases and ensures that the sequence is computed correctly even when `n` is large.
