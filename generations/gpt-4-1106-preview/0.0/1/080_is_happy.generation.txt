Here is the Julia function `is_happy` that checks if a string is happy according to the given definition:

```julia
function is_happy(s::String)::Bool
    # A string is not happy if its length is less than 3
    if length(s) < 3
        return false
    end

    # Check every 3 consecutive letters to ensure they are distinct
    for i in 1:(length(s) - 2)
        if s[i] == s[i+1] || s[i] == s[i+2] || s[i+1] == s[i+2]
            return false
        end
    end

    # If all checks pass, the string is happy
    return true
end
```

You can use this function to check if a string is happy by passing the string as an argument to the function.
