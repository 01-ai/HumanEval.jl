```julia
function make_a_pile(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    stones = [n]
    for i in 2:n
        next_stone = i + (i % 2 == 0 ? 1 : 0)
        push!(stones, next_stone)
    end
    return stones
end
```

This function `make_a_pile` takes an integer `n` as input and creates a vector representing the pile of stones as described. It starts with `n` stones on the first level and then adds the next odd or even number for subsequent levels, depending on whether `n` is odd or even, respectively.
