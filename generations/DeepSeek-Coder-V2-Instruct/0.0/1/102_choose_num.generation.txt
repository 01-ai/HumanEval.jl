 Here's the implementation of the `choose_num` function in Julia:

```julia
function choose_num(x::Int, y::Int)::Int
    # Ensure x is less than or equal to y
    if x > y
        return -1
    end

    # Start from the largest number in the range and move downwards
    for num in y:-1:x
        if num % 2 == 0
            return num
        end
    end

    # If no even number is found, return -1
    return -1
end
```

This function checks each number in the range from `y` to `x` (inclusive) in descending order and returns the first even number it finds. If no even number is found, it returns `-1`.
