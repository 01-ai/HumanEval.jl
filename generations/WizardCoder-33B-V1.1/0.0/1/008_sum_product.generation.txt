Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    if isempty(numbers)
        return (0, 1)
    else
        return (sum(numbers), prod(numbers))
    end
end
```

This function first checks if the input vector is empty. If it is, it returns a tuple of 0 and 1. If it is not, it calculates the sum and product of the numbers in the vector using the built-in `sum` and `prod` functions, respectively, and returns them as a tuple.
