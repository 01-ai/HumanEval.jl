To implement the `mean_absolute_deviation` function in Julia, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers.
2. Compute the absolute difference between each number and the mean.
3. Calculate the average of these absolute differences to get the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).

Here is the Julia code for the function:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Step 1: Calculate the mean of the numbers
    mean_value = mean(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Compute the absolute differences from the mean
    absolute_differences = abs.(numbers .- mean_value)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the average of these absolute differences
    mad = mean(absolute_differences)
    
    return mad
end
```

This function uses vectorized operations (`.`, such as `abs.` and `.-`) for efficient computation of the absolute differences. The `mean` function from Julia's standard library is used to calculate both the mean of the input numbers and the mean of the absolute differences.
