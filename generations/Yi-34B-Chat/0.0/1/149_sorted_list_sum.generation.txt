```julia
function sorted_list_sum(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths
    even_length_strings = filter(x -> length(x) % 2 == 0, xs)
    
    # Sort the strings by length (ascending), and then by alphabetical order
    sorted_strings = sort(even_length_strings, by = length, alg = QuickSort)
    
    # If two strings have the same length, sort them alphabetically
    sorted_strings = sort(sorted_strings)
    
    return sorted_strings
end
```

This function filters out strings with odd lengths from the input list, then sorts the remaining strings by length (ascending) using `sort` with a custom comparison function `by = length`. If two strings have the same length, they are sorted alphabetically using the default `sort` algorithm (which is `QuickSort` in Julia). Finally, the sorted list is returned.
