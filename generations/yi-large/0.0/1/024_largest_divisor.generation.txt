Here is the implementation of the `largest_divisor` function in Julia:

```julia
function largest_divisor(n::Int)::Int
    # Start from n-1 and find the largest divisor
    for i in n-1:-1:1
        if n % i == 0
            return i
        end
    end
    return 1  # If no divisor other than 1 is found, return 1
end
```

This function iterates from `n-1` down to `1`, checking each number to see if it divides `n` evenly. The first number that divides `n` without leaving a remainder is returned as the largest divisor. If no divisor other than 1 is found (which should not happen unless `n` is 1 or a prime number), it returns 1 as the smallest factor other than `n` itself.
