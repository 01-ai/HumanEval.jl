function decode_shift(s::String)::String

end
```

To implement the `decode_shift` function, you would need to reverse the process done by `encode_shift`. This involves shifting each character in the input string back by 5 positions in the alphabet. If the shift goes beyond 'z', it should wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet. Here's how you might implement the `decode_shift` function:

```julia
function decode_shift(s::String)::String
    # Step 1: Loop over each character in the string
    decoded_string = ""
    for c in s
        # Step 2: Calculate the shift
        shift_amount = (c - 'a' - 5) % 26
        # Step 3: Add the shifted character to the decoded string
        decoded_string += (shift_amount + 'a')
    end
    return decoded_string
end
```

This function calculates the shift amount by finding the difference between the character and 'a', then subtracting 5 to reverse the original shift. It then takes the remainder of the division by 26 to ensure the shift doesn't go beyond 'z'. Finally, it adds the shifted character to the decoded string.
