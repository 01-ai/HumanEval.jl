### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize the Tribonacci sequence**: Start by creating a vector to hold the Tribonacci sequence. Since the sequence is defined recursively, we need to initialize the first few values manually. According to the problem statement, `tri(1) = 1`. However, the recursive definition for odd numbers includes `tri(n + 1)`, which implies we need to calculate values beyond `n` to compute `tri(n)` for odd `n`. To simplify, we'll compute values up to `n` and handle edge cases as needed.

2. **Handle Base Cases**: For `n = 1`, return `[1]`. For `n = 2`, return `[1, 2]` since `tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2`.

3. **Compute Tribonacci Values**: Iterate from `3` to `n`, and for each `i`, compute `tri(i)` based on the given rules:
   - If `i` is even, use the formula `tri(i) = 1 + i / 2`.
   - If `i` is odd, calculate `tri(i)` as the sum of `tri(i - 1)`, `tri(i - 2)`, and `tri(i + 1)` if `i + 1` is within bounds; otherwise, just sum `tri(i - 1)` and `tri(i - 2)`.

4. **Return the Tribonacci Sequence**: After populating the vector with the first `n` Tribonacci numbers, return the vector.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function tri(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Handle base cases
    if n == 1
        return [1]
    elseif n == 2
        return [1, 2]
    end
    
    # Initialize the Tribonacci sequence with the first two values
    tribonacci = [1, 2]
    
    # Compute subsequent values of the Tribonacci sequence
    for i in 3:n
        if i % 2 == 0
            # If i is even, use the formula: 1 + i / 2
            push!(tribonacci, 1 + i รท 2)
        else
            # If i is odd, sum the previous two and the next one if within bounds
            tri_i = tribonacci[end] + tribonacci[end - 1]
