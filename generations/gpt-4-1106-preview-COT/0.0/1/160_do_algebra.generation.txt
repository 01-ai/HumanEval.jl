### Step-by-step Outline:

1. Verify that the input lists `operator` and `operand` meet the specified conditions:
   - The length of `operator` is equal to the length of `operand` minus one.
   - `operand` contains non-negative integers.
   - `operator` contains at least one operator, and `operand` contains at least two operands.

2. Initialize an expression string with the first operand.

3. Iterate over the `operator` list and for each operator:
   - Append the operator to the expression string.
   - Append the next operand from the `operand` list to the expression string.

4. Evaluate the expression string using Julia's `eval` function to compute the result.

5. Return the result of the evaluation.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function do_algebra(operator::Vector{String}, operand::Vector{Int})
    # Step 1: Verify input conditions
    if length(operator) != length(operand) - 1
        error("The length of operator list must be equal to the length of operand list minus one.")
    end
    if any(x -> x < 0, operand)
        error("Operands must be non-negative integers.")
    end
    if length(operator) < 1 || length(operand) < 2
        error("Operator list must have at least one operator, and operand list must have at least two operands.")
    end

    # Step 2: Initialize the expression string
    expression = string(operand[1])

    # Step 3: Build the expression string
    for i in 1:length(operator)
        expression *= " " * operator[i] * " " * string(operand[i + 1])
    end

    # Step 4: Evaluate the expression
    result = eval(Meta.parse(expression))

    # Step 5: Return the result
    return result
end
```

Please note that using `eval` can be dangerous if the input is not properly sanitized, as it can execute arbitrary code. In this case, we assume that the input is controlled and does not pose a security risk.
