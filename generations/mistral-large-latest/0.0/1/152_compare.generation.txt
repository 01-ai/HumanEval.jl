Sure, here is the Julia function based on the given docstring:

```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    return abs.(game .- guess)
end
```

This function takes two vectors `game` and `guess` of equal length as input. It uses the broadcasting feature of Julia to subtract each element of `guess` from the corresponding element of `game`. The `abs` function is then used to get the absolute value of the differences. The result is a new vector of the same length as the input vectors, where each element is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.
