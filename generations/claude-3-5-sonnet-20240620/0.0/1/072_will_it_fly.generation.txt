Here's a Julia function that implements the `will_it_fly` logic as described:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the object is balanced (palindromic)
    is_balanced = q == reverse(q)
    
    # Calculate the sum of elements
    total_weight = sum(q)
    
    # Check if it's balanced and the total weight is within the limit
    return is_balanced && total_weight <= w
end
```

This function does the following:

1. It first checks if the object `q` is balanced by comparing it with its reverse. If they are equal, the object is palindromic and thus balanced.

2. It calculates the total weight of the object by summing all its elements.

3. Finally, it returns `true` if both conditions are met:
   - The object is balanced (palindromic)
   - The total weight is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`

This implementation should work correctly for all the given examples:

```julia
julia> will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)
false

julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)
false

julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)
true

julia> will_it_fly([3], 5)
true
```

The function correctly handles edge cases like single-element vectors (which are always palindromic) and empty vectors (which are also palindromic and have a sum of 0).
