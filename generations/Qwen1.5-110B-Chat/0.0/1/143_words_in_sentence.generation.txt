```julia
function words_in_sentence(sentence::String)::String
    # Helper function to check if a number is prime
    isprime(n::Int) = n > 1 && all(n % d â‰  0 for d in 2:(isqrt(n)))

    # Split the sentence into words
    words = split(sentence)

    # Filter words with prime length
    prime_length_words = filter(word -> isprime(length(word)), words)

    # Join the filtered words back into a string with spaces
    return join(prime_length_words, " ")
end
```

This Julia function `words_in_sentence` first defines a helper function `isprime` to check if a number is prime. It then splits the input sentence into individual words and filters out those words that have a prime number length. Finally, it joins the filtered words into a new string, separated by spaces, and returns this string. The examples provided in the docstring are also valid test cases for this function.
