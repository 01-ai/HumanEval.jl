Sure, here is the Julia function that implements the given docstring:

```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences
    sentences = split(s, r"[.!?]")

    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0

    # Iterate over each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I" after stripping leading whitespace
        if startswith(strip(sentence), "I")
            # Increment the boredom counter
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end

    # Return the total number of boredoms
    return boredom_count
end
```
This function works by first splitting the input string into sentences using the regular expression `r"[.!?]"`. It then iterates over each sentence, checking if it starts with the word "I" after stripping any leading whitespace. If it does, it increments a counter. Finally, it returns the total number of boredoms found.
