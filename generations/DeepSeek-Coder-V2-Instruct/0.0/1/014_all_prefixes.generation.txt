 Here's the implementation of the `all_prefixes` function in Julia:

```julia
function all_prefixes(s::String)::Vector{String}
    prefixes = Vector{String}()
    for i in 1:length(s)
        push!(prefixes, s[1:i])
    end
    return prefixes
end
```

This function iterates over the length of the input string `s` and collects all prefixes from the shortest to the longest, storing them in a vector which is then returned.
