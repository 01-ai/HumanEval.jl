Certainly! Below is the Julia function `triangle_area` that calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side `a` and the height `h`.

```julia
"""
    triangle_area(a, h)

Given length of a side and height, return area for a triangle.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```
"""
function triangle_area(a, h)
    return 0.5 * a * h
end
```

You can use this function in Julia to calculate the area of a triangle with the given side length and height.
