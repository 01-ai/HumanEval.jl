To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Sort the input array in ascending order.
2. Initialize a minimum difference as infinity and two variables to store the closest pair.
3. Iterate through the array and for each pair of consecutive elements, calculate their difference.
4. If the difference is less than the current minimum difference, update the minimum difference and the closest pair.
5. Return the closest pair.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above steps:

```julia
function find_closest_elements(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Tuple{Float64, Float64}
    # Step 1: Sort the input array in ascending order
    sort!(numbers)

    # Step 2: Initialize a minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = typemax(Float64)
    closest_pair = (0.0, 0.0)

    # Step 3: Iterate through the array
    for i in 1:(length(numbers) - 1)
        # Calculate the difference between the current pair of elements
        diff = numbers[i + 1] - numbers[i]

        # Step 4: Update the minimum difference and the closest pair if necessary
        if diff < min_diff
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i], numbers[i + 1])
        end
    end

    # Step 5: Return the closest pair
    return closest_pair
end
```

This function works by first sorting the input array, which allows it to find the closest pair of elements in linear time. The time complexity of the function is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the minimum difference and the closest pair.
