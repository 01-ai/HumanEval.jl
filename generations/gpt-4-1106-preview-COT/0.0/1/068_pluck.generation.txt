### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Check if the input vector `xs` is empty. If it is, return an empty vector `[]`.
2. Initialize variables to store the smallest even value found and its index. Set the smallest value to a large number (e.g., `typemax(Int)`) and the index to -1 to indicate that it hasn't been found yet.
3. Iterate over the elements of the vector `xs` with their indices.
4. For each element, check if it is even.
5. If the element is even and smaller than the current smallest even value, update the smallest value and its index.
6. After the iteration, check if the smallest even value was updated (i.e., the index is not -1).
7. If an even value was found, return a vector containing the smallest even value and its index.
8. If no even value was found, return an empty vector `[]`.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function pluck(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Step 1: Check if the input vector is empty
    if isempty(xs)
        return Int[]
    end

    # Step 2: Initialize variables for the smallest even value and its index
    smallest_even = typemax(Int)
    smallest_index = -1

    # Step 3: Iterate over the elements and their indices
    for (index, value) in enumerate(xs)
        # Step 4: Check if the current element is even
        if value % 2 == 0
            # Step 5: Update the smallest even value and its index if necessary
            if value < smallest_even
                smallest_even = value
                smallest_index = index
            end
        end
    end

    # Step 6: Check if an even value was found
    if smallest_index != -1
        # Step 7: Return the smallest even value and its index
        return [smallest_even, smallest_index]
    else
        # Step 8: Return an empty vector if no even value was found
        return Int[]
    end
end
```
