 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `parse_music` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}

Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII
format. Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers
corresponding to how many beats does each not last.

Here is a legend:

  - `"o"` - whole note, lasts four beats
  - `"o|"` - half note, lasts two
  - `".|"` - quarter note, lasts one beat

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parse_music("o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o")
11-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 2
 1
 2
 2
 1
 1
 1
 1
 4
 4
```
"""
function parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}
    # Split the input string by spaces to get individual notes
    notes = split(music_string)

    # Initialize an empty vector to store the beats
    beats = Vector{Int}()

    # Define a dictionary to map notes to their corresponding beats
    note_to_beats = Dict("o" => 4, "o|" => 2, ".|" => 1)

    # Iterate over each note and append the corresponding beats to the vector
    for note in notes
        if note in keys(note_to_beats)
            push!(beats, note_to_beats[note])
        else
            error("Invalid note: $note")
        end
    end

    return beats
end
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into individual notes using the `split` function. It then initializes an empty vector to store the beats. A dictionary is used to map each note to its corresponding number of beats. The function iterates over each note, looks up its value in the dictionary, and appends the corresponding number of beats to the vector. If an invalid note is encountered, an error is thrown.

You can test the function with the provided example to ensure it works as expected.
