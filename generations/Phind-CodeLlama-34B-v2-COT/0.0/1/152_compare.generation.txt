Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize an empty Vector to store the results.
2. Iterate over each element in the input arrays.
3. For each pair of elements, calculate the absolute difference and append it to the results array.
4. Return the results array.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Initialize an empty Vector to store the results
    results = Vector{Int}(undef, length(game))

    # Iterate over each element in the input arrays
    for i in 1:length(game)
        # Calculate the absolute difference and append it to the results array
        results[i] = abs(game[i] - guess[i])
    end

    # Return the results array
    return results
end
```

This function takes two vectors as input, `game` and `guess`, both of which contain integers. It returns a vector of integers, where each element is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`. If the guess was correct, the difference is 0.
