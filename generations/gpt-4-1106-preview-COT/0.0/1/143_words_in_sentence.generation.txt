To implement the `words_in_sentence` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define a helper function `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` and returns `true` if `n` is a prime number, and `false` otherwise.
2. Split the input `sentence` into words using the `split` function.
3. Filter the list of words by keeping only those whose lengths are prime numbers. We will use the `is_prime` function to check the length of each word.
4. Join the filtered words back into a string, separated by spaces, using the `join` function.
5. Return the resulting string.

Now, let's write the code for the `words_in_sentence` function and the `is_prime` helper function.
