Sure, here is the Julia function based on the given docstring:

```julia
function do_algebra(operator::Vector{String}, operand::Vector{Int})
    # Check if the lengths of operator and operand lists are valid
    if length(operator) != length(operand) - 1
        throw(ArgumentError("The length of operator list should be equal to the length of operand list minus one."))
    end

    # Start the evaluation with the first operand
    result = operand[1]

    # Evaluate the expression based on the given operator and operand lists
    for i in 1:length(operator)
        if operator[i] == "+"
            result += operand[i+1]
        elseif operator[i] == "-"
            result -= operand[i+1]
        elseif operator[i] == "*"
            result *= operand[i+1]
        elseif operator[i] == "รท"
            result = div(result, operand[i+1])
        elseif operator[i] == "^"
            result = result ^ operand[i+1]
        else
            throw(ArgumentError("Invalid operator."))
        end
    end

    # Return the result of the evaluation
    return result
end
```
This function first checks if the lengths of the operator and operand lists are valid. Then it starts the evaluation with the first operand and goes through the operator and operand lists to evaluate the expression. Finally, it returns the result of the evaluation.
