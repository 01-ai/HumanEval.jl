Here is the Julia function that sums numbers from 1 to n:

```julia
function sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int
    return n * (n + 1) � 2
end
```

This function uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. The `�` operator is used for integer division, which discards the remainder and returns an integer.
