 Here's the implementation of the `count_nums` function in Julia:

```julia
function count_nums(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    count = 0
    for num in xs
        sum_digits = 0
        abs_num = abs(num)
        while abs_num > 0
            sum_digits += abs_num % 10 * (num < 0 ? -1 : 1)
            abs_num = div(abs_num, 10)
        end
        if sum_digits > 0
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates over each number in the input vector `xs`. For each number, it calculates the sum of its digits, taking into account the sign of the number. If the sum of the digits is greater than 0, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.
