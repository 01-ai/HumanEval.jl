To implement the `min_path` function, we need to perform a depth-first search (DFS) from each cell in the grid, keeping track of the path length and the values visited. Since we need to find the lexicographically smallest path, we will prioritize visiting cells with smaller values first.

Here's the implementation of the `min_path` function:

```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = size(grid, 1)
    # Function to get the value at a given position
    value_at(pos) = grid[pos[1]][pos[2]]
    
    # Function to get the neighbors of a given position
    function neighbors(pos)
        i, j = pos
        nbs = []
        for (di, dj) in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 1 <= ni <= N && 1 <= nj <= N
                push!(nbs, (ni, nj))
            end
        end
        return nbs
    end
    
    # Function to perform DFS and find the minimum path
    function dfs(pos, path, length)
        if length == k
            return path
        end
        min_path = []
        for nb in neighbors(pos)
            new_path = dfs(nb, [path..., value_at(nb)], length + 1)
            if isempty(min_path) || (!isempty(new_path) && new_path < min_path)
                min_path = new_path
            end
        end
        return min_path
    end
    
    # Initialize the minimum path with maximum possible values
    min_path_result = fill(N * N + 1, k)
    # Perform DFS from each cell
    for i in 1:N
        for j in 1:N
            start_pos = (i, j)
            path = dfs(start_pos, [value_at(start_pos)], 1)
            if path < min_path_result
                min_path_result = path
            end
        end
    end
    
    return min_path_result
end
```

This function first defines helper functions to get the value at a given position and to get the neighbors of a position. Then, it defines a recursive `dfs` function to perform a depth-first search. Finally, it iterates over each cell in the
