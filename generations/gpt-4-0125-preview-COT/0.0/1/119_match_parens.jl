    match_parens(lst::Vector{String})::String

You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open parentheses
"(" or close parentheses ")" only. Your job is to check if it is possible to
concatenate the two strings in some order, that the resulting string will be
good. A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
are balanced. For example: the string "(())()" is good, while the string "())"
is not. Return "Yes" if there"s a way to make a good string, and return "No"
otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match_parens(["()(", ")"])
"Yes"

julia> match_parens([")", ")"])
"No"
```

### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Input Validation**: Check if the input list `lst` contains exactly two strings. If not, return "No" because the problem statement specifies that the list will contain exactly two strings.

2. **Count Parentheses**: For each string in the list, count the number of open parentheses "(" and close parentheses ")". This can be done by iterating through each character of the strings and maintaining a count for open and close parentheses.

3. **Determine Concatenation Order**:
    - If the first string has more open parentheses than close parentheses, it should come first in the concatenation order. The second string should then balance the excess open parentheses with its close parentheses.
    - Conversely, if the first string has more close parentheses, it should come second, assuming the second string can provide the necessary open parentheses to balance it.
    - If both strings have an equal number of open and close parentheses, they are already balanced individually, and their order does not matter.

4. **Check for Good String**:
    - After determining the potential order, simulate the concatenation and check if the resulting string is good (balanced).
    - This involves going through the concatenated string and ensuring that at no point the number of close parentheses exceeds the number of open parentheses before it. Also, by the end of the string, the numbers of open and close parentheses should be equal.

5. **Return Result**:
    - If it is possible to concatenate the strings in an order that results in a balanced string, return "Yes".
    - Otherwise, return "No".
