Here is the Julia function that removes duplicates from a vector of integers:

```julia
function remove_duplicates(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    counts = Dict{Int, Int}()
    result = Int[]

    for num in numbers
        if haskey(counts, num)
            counts[num] += 1
        else
            counts[num] = 1
        end
    end

    for num in numbers
        if counts[num] == 1
            pushfirst(result, num)
        else
            counts[num] -= 1
        end
    end

    return result
end
```

This function works by first counting the occurrences of each number in the input vector. Then it iterates over the input vector again, adding each number to the result vector if it occurs exactly once. The order of the numbers in the result vector is the same as in the input vector.
