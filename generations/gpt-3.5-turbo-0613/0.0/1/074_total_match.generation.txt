Here is the implementation of the `total_match` function in Julia:

```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    total_xs = sum(length.(xs))
    total_ys = sum(length.(ys))
    
    if total_xs < total_ys
        return xs
    elseif total_xs > total_ys
        return ys
    else
        return xs
    end
end
```

This function calculates the total number of characters in each list using the `sum` function and the `length` function applied to each string in the list. It then compares the totals and returns the list with the smaller total. If the totals are equal, it returns the first list.
