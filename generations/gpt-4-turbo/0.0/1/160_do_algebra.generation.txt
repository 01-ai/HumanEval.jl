This function `do_algebra` takes two vectors, one of strings representing operators and one of integers representing operands. It processes these lists to compute a result based on the sequence of operations specified. The function supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, floor division, and exponentiation. It starts with the first operand and then iteratively applies each operator to the accumulated result and the next operand in the list.
