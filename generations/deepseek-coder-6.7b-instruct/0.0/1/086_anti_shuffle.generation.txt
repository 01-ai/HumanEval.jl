Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function anti_shuffle(s::String)::String
    words = split(s, " ")
    ordered_words = map(word -> join(sort(collect(word))), words)
    return join(ordered_words, " ")
end
```

This function works by splitting the input string into words, then for each word, it sorts the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values and joins them back together. The sorted words are then joined back together with spaces in between.

The `sort` function in Julia sorts the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values. The `collect` function is used to convert the string into a collection of characters that can be sorted. The `join` function is used to convert the sorted characters back into a string.
