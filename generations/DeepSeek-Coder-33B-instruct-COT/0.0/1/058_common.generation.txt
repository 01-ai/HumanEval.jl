Here is a step-by-step outline of how to solve this problem:

1. Create a function named `common` that takes two vectors as input.
2. Use the `intersect` function to find the common elements between the two vectors.
3. Use the `unique` function to remove any duplicate common elements.
4. Use the `sort` function to sort the unique common elements.
5. Return the sorted unique common elements.

Here is the Julia code that implements this outline:

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    common_elements = intersect(l1, l2)
    unique_common_elements = unique(common_elements)
    sorted_unique_common_elements = sort(unique_common_elements)
    return sorted_unique_common_elements
end
```

This function will return the sorted unique common elements between two vectors.
