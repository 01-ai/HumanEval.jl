 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function in Julia based on the given doc string:

```julia
"""
    greatest_common_divisor(a::Int, b::Int)::Int

Return a greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
1

julia> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
5
```
"""
function greatest_common_divisor(a::Int, b::Int)::Int
    while b != 0
        a, b = b, a % b
    end
    return abs(a)
end
```

This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The algorithm repeatedly replaces the larger number by its remainder when divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The other number at this point is the GCD. The `abs` function is used to ensure the result is non-negative.
