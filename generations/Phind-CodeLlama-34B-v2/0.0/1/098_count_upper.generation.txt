Here is the Julia function that implements the `count_upper` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function count_upper(s::String)::Int
    count = 0
    upper_vowels = ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
    for i in 1:length(s)
        if i % 2 != 0 && s[i] in upper_vowels
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates over the string `s` and checks if the character at the odd index is an uppercase vowel. If it is, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the `count` variable which holds the number of uppercase vowels at odd indices.
