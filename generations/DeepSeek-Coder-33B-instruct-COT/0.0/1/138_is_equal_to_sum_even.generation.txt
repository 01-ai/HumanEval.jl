Here is a step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Check if the number `n` is greater than or equal to 8. If it is not, return false because it is not possible to write it as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
2. If `n` is greater than or equal to 8, check if the remainder of `n` divided by 4 is 0. If it is, return true because `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If it is not, return false.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int)::Bool
    if n < 8
        return false
    elseif n % 4 == 0
        return true
    else
        return false
    end
end
```

This function works by first checking if `n` is less than 8. If it is, it returns false because it is not possible to write `n` as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If `n` is not less than 8, it then checks if `n` is divisible by 4. If it is, it returns true because `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. If `n` is not divisible by 4, it returns false.
