Here is the Julia function that implements the above logic:

```julia
function prime_length(s::String)::Bool
    n = length(s)
    if n < 2
        return false
    end
    for i in 2:sqrt(n)
        if n % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

This function works by first checking if the length of the string is less than 2, in which case it returns `false`. Then it checks if the length is a prime number by iterating from 2 to the square root of the length and checking if the length is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, it returns `false`. If no divisors are found, it returns `true`.
