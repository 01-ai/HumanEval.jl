Here is a step-by-step outline of how to solve this problem:

1. Initialize an empty vector to store the beats.
2. Split the input string into individual notes using the `split` function.
3. Iterate over each note in the split string.
4. For each note, check if it is a whole note (`"o"`), half note (`"o|"`), or quarter note (`".|"`).
5. Depending on the note, append the corresponding number of beats to the vector.
6. Return the vector of beats.

Here is the Julia code that implements this algorithm:

```julia
function parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}
    beats = Int[]
    notes = split(music_string)
    for note in notes
        if note == "o"
            push_beats = 4
        elseif note == "o|"
            push_beats = 2
        elseif note == ".|"
            push_beats = 1
        else
            error("Invalid note: $note")
        end
        push_beats = push_beats
    end
    return beats
end
```

This function will throw an error if it encounters an invalid note. You can modify this behavior as needed.
