```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    result = BigInt(1)
    for i in 1:n
        result *= factorial(BigInt(i))
    end
    return result
end
```
This function calculates the special factorial as described, by multiplying the factorial of each integer from 1 to `n`. The use of `BigInt` ensures that the result can handle very large numbers, which are likely to occur in this factorial computation for larger values of `n`.
