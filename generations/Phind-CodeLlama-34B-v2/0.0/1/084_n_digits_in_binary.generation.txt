Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function n_digits_in_binary(N::Int)::String
    # Convert the integer to binary and remove the "0b" prefix
    binary = string(N, base = 2)[3:end]

    # Calculate the sum of the digits in the binary representation
    sum_of_digits = sum(parse(Int, digit) for digit in binary)

    # Convert the sum back to binary
    return string(sum_of_digits, base = 2)
end
```

This function first converts the input integer to its binary representation (as a string), then calculates the sum of its digits, and finally converts this sum back to binary. The use of `string(N, base = 2)` for conversion between integer and binary is a Julia feature.

Here is how it works for the provided examples:

```julia
julia> n_digits_in_binary(1000)
"1"

julia> n_digits_in_binary(150)
"110"

julia> n_digits_in_binary(147)
"1100"
```
