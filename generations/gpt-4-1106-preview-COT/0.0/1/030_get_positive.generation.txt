### Step-by-Step Outline

1. Define a function `get_positive` that takes a single argument `xs`, which is a vector of integers.
2. Use a list comprehension or the `filter` function to iterate over the elements of `xs`.
3. In the iteration, check if each element is greater than zero.
4. Collect all the elements that are greater than zero into a new vector.
5. Return the new vector containing only the positive elements.

### Julia Code

```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector)
    # Use a list comprehension to filter out only positive numbers
    positive_xs = [x for x in xs if x > 0]
    return positive_xs
end
```

Alternatively, you can use the `filter` function:

```julia
function get_positive(xs::Vector)
    # Use the filter function to achieve the same result
    positive_xs = filter(x -> x > 0, xs)
    return positive_xs
end
```

Both implementations will yield the same result. Let's proceed with the list comprehension approach for the actual code implementation.
