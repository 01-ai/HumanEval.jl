To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the length of the second word is less than or equal to the length of the first word. If not, return false because the second word cannot be a substring of the first word.
2. Generate all rotations of the second word.
3. Check if any of the rotations is a substring of the first word.

Here is the Julia code for the above steps:

```julia
function cycpattern_check(a::String, b::String)::Bool
    # Step 1: Check if the length of the second word is less than or equal to the length of the first word
    if length(b) > length(a)
        return false
    end

    # Step 2: Generate all rotations of the second word
    rotations = [b[i:end]*b[1:i-1] for i in 1:length(b)]

    # Step 3: Check if any of the rotations is a substring of the first word
    for rotation in rotations
        if occursin(rotation, a)
            return true
        end
    end

    # If none of the rotations is a substring of the first word, return false
    return false
end
```

This function works by first checking if the second word can possibly be a substring of the first word. If it can, the function then generates all possible rotations of the second word and checks if any of these rotations is a substring of the first word. If at least one rotation is a substring, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
