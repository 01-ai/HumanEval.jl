```julia
function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(s::String)::Bool
    # Check if the string is empty or the last character is a space
    if s == "" || s[end] == ' '
        return false
    end

    # Check if the last character is an alphabetical character
    if !isalpha(s[end])
        return false
    end

    # Check if the last character is not a part of a word
    if s[end - 1] != ' ' || s[end - 2] != ' '
        return true
    end

    # If the last character is a part of a word, return false
    return false
end
```

This function checks if the last character of a string is an alphabetical character and is not a part of a word. It does this by checking if the last character is a space or not, and if the character before the last is also a space. If both conditions are met, the character is considered to be not a part of a word, and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.
