Here is the Julia function that implements the Mean Absolute Deviation:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    mean_value = sum(numbers) / length(numbers)
    absolute_deviations = abs.(numbers .- mean_value)
    return sum(absolute_deviations) / length(numbers)
end
```

This function first calculates the mean of the input numbers. Then it calculates the absolute deviation of each number from the mean. Finally, it returns the mean of these absolute deviations.
