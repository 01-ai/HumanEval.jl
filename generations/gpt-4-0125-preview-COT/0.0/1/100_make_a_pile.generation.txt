### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize Variables**: Start by initializing a vector to store the number of stones in each level. Also, initialize a variable to keep track of the current number of stones, which starts with `n`.

2. **Determine the Pattern**: Based on the value of `n`, determine whether we will be adding odd or even numbers to the pile. This can be done by checking if `n` is odd or even.

3. **Build the Pile**: Use a loop to add the appropriate number of stones to each level. For each iteration:
   - Add the current number of stones to the vector.
   - Determine the next number of stones to add based on whether we're adding odd or even numbers. This can be done by adding 2 to the current number of stones.

4. **Return the Vector**: After the loop has added stones to all `n` levels, return the vector.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function make_a_pile(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Step 1: Initialize the vector and the current number of stones
    pile = Int[]
    current_stones = n
    
    # Step 2: Determine the pattern (odd or even)
    increment = n % 2 == 0 ? 2 : 2  # Both odd and even numbers will increment by 2
    
    # Step 3: Build the pile
    for _ in 1:n
        push!(pile, current_stones)
        current_stones += increment  # Move to the next number in the sequence
    end
    
    # Step 4: Return the vector
    return pile
end
```

This function starts with `n` stones and builds a pile of `n` levels, where each level has either the next odd or even number of stones, depending on whether `n` is odd or even. However, since both odd and even numbers follow the same increment pattern (adding 2 each time), the distinction in step 2 is not necessary but included for clarity.
