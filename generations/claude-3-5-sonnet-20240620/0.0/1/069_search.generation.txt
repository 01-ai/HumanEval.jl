To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number in the list.
2. Iterate through the dictionary, checking each number against the criteria.
3. Keep track of the maximum number that satisfies the conditions.
4. Return the result or -1 if no number satisfies the conditions.

Here's the Julia function that implements this solution:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector)::Int
    # Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each number
    freq = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for num in numbers
        freq[num] = get(freq, num, 0) + 1
    end
    
    max_num = -1
    
    # Iterate through the dictionary
    for (num, count) in freq
        # Check if the number satisfies the conditions
        if num > 0 && count >= num && num > max_num
            max_num = num
        end
    end
    
    return max_num
end
```

Let's break down the function:

1. We create a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each number in the input vector.

2. We iterate through the `numbers` vector and populate the `freq` dictionary. The `get(freq, num, 0)` function is used to handle the case when a number is encountered for the first time.

3. We initialize `max_num` to -1, which will be our return value if no number satisfies the conditions.

4. We iterate through the `freq` dictionary, checking each number against the conditions:
   - The number must be greater than 0
   - Its frequency must be greater than or equal to the number itself
   - It must be greater than the current `max_num`

5. If a number satisfies all conditions, we update `max_num`.

6. Finally, we return `max_num`, which will be the greatest number satisfying the conditions or -1 if no such number exists.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input vector, as we iterate through the vector once to create the frequency dictionary and then iterate through the dictionary (which at most has n entries) to find the result.

You can test this function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 2
println(search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: 3
println(search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]))  # Output: -1
```

These should produce the expected outputs as given in the problem statement.
