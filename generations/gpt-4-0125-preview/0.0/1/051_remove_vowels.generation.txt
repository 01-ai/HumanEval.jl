```julia
function remove_vowels(text::String)::String
    # Define a string of vowels to check against, including uppercase for case insensitivity
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    # Use the filter function to keep only characters not in the vowels string
    return filter(c -> !(c in vowels), text)
end
```

This Julia function `remove_vowels` takes a string as input and returns a new string with all vowels removed. It does so by filtering out any character that is present in the `vowels` string, which includes both lowercase and uppercase vowels to ensure case insensitivity.
