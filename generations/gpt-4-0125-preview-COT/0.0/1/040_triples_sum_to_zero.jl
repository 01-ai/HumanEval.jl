    triples_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool

Takes a list of integers as an input. It returns `true` if there are three
distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
false

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
true

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
false

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
true

julia> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
false
```

### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Check for List Length**: First, check if the list has fewer than 3 elements. If it does, return `false` immediately since it's impossible to find three distinct elements that sum to zero in a list with fewer than three elements.

2. **Sort the List**: Sort the list in ascending order. This step will make it easier to navigate through the list and apply the two-pointer technique.

3. **Iterate through the List**: Use a loop to iterate through the list. For each element in the list (considered as the first element of a potential triplet), apply the two-pointer technique to find if there exists a pair in the remaining part of the list that sums up to the negative value of the current element.

4. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
    - Initialize two pointers: one at the element immediately after the current element (`left`) and the other at the end of the list (`right`).
    - While `left` is less than `right`, check if the sum of the elements at `left`, `right`, and the current element is zero.
        - If the sum is zero, return `true` because we've found a triplet that sums to zero.
        - If the sum is less than zero, move the `left` pointer one step to the right (increment `left`) to increase the sum.
        - If the sum is greater than zero, move the `right` pointer one step to the left (decrement `right`) to decrease the sum.
    - If no such pair is found for the current element, continue to the next element in the list.

5. **Return False**: If the loop completes without finding any triplet that sums to zero, return `false`.
