### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize a sum variable**: Start with a variable to accumulate the sum of the processed elements.

2. **Iterate through the list with indexes**: Use a loop that also keeps track of the index of each element. Remember that Julia indexes are 1-based.

3. **Check the index for specific conditions**:
    - If the index is a multiple of 3 (but not a multiple of 4), square the element.
    - If the index is a multiple of 4 (and implicitly not a multiple of 3 due to the order of conditions), cube the element.
    - If the index does not meet the above conditions, add the element as it is.

4. **Add the processed element to the sum**: After processing an element based on its index, add it to the sum.

5. **Return the sum**: After iterating through the entire list, return the accumulated sum.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function sum_squares(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Step 1: Initialize the sum variable
    total_sum = 0

    # Step 2: Iterate through the list with indexes
    for (index, value) in enumerate(xs)
        # Step 3: Check the index for specific conditions
        if index % 3 == 0 && index % 4 != 0
            # Square the element if index is a multiple of 3 (and not of 4)
            total_sum += value^2
        elseif index % 4 == 0
            # Cube the element if index is a multiple of 4
            total_sum += value^3
        else
            # Add the element as it is
            total_sum += value
        end
    end

    # Step 5: Return the sum
    return total_sum
end
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps to ensure that the function behaves as specified, processing elements based on their index and accumulating a sum to return.
