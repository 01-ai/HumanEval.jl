Here's the implementation of the `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` function in Julia:

```julia
function check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(s::String)::Bool
    # Check if the string is empty
    if isempty(s)
        return false
    end

    # Get the last character of the string
    last_char = s[end]

    # Check if the last character is an alphabetical character
    if isletter(last_char)
        # Check if the last character is not part of a word
        # This is done by checking if the last character is followed by a space or is at the end of the string
        if endswith(s, " $last_char") || endswith(s, last_char)
            return true
        else
            return false
        end
    else
        return false
    end
end
```

This function first checks if the string is empty. If it is, it returns `false`. Then, it checks if the last character is an alphabetical character. If it is, it further checks if this character is not part of a word by ensuring it is either at the end of the string or followed by a space. If these conditions are met, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
