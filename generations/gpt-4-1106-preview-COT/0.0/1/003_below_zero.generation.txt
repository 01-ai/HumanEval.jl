To implement the `below_zero` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current balance, starting at zero.
2. Iterate through each operation in the `operations` vector.
3. Update the current balance by adding the current operation's value.
4. Check if the current balance falls below zero at any point during the iteration.
5. If the balance goes below zero, return `true`.
6. If the iteration completes without the balance going below zero, return `false`.

Now, let's write the code for the `below_zero` function:

```julia
function below_zero(operations::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # Step 1: Initialize the current balance
    current_balance = 0

    # Step 2: Iterate through the operations
    for operation in operations
        # Step 3: Update the current balance
        current_balance += operation

        # Step 4: Check if the balance is below zero
        if current_balance < 0
            # Step 5: Return true if balance is below zero
            return true
        end
    end

    # Step 6: Return false if balance never went below zero
    return false
end
```

This function will correctly return `true` if the balance goes below zero at any point, and `false` otherwise, as demonstrated in the provided examples.
