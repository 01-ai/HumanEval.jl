```julia
function palindrome_with_append(s::String)::String
    # Find the longest postfix of s that is a palindrome
    i = length(s)
    while i > 0 && s[i] != s[i-1]
        i -= 1
    end

    # Append the reverse of the prefix before the palindromic suffix
    return s * reverse(s[1:i-1])
end
```

This function finds the longest postfix of the input string that is a palindrome, and then appends the reverse of the prefix before the palindromic suffix to the end of the string.
