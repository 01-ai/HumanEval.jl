Here is the step-by-step outline of the function:

1. Filter out the strings with odd lengths from the input list.
2. Sort the resulting list of strings by their lengths.
3. If there are strings with the same length, sort them alphabetically.
4. Return the sorted list.

Now, let's write the Julia code for the function based on the outline:

```julia
function sorted_list_sum(xs::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Filter out the strings with odd lengths
    even_length_strings = filter(x -> length(x) % 2 == 0, xs)

    # Sort the list of strings by their lengths and alphabetically
    sorted_strings = sort(even_length_strings, by = x -> (length(x), x))

    return sorted_strings
end
```

This function first filters out the strings with odd lengths from the input list using the `filter` function. Then it sorts the resulting list of strings by their lengths and alphabetically using the `sort` function. Finally, it returns the sorted list.
