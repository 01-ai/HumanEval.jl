Here is a possible implementation for the `search` function:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector)::Int
    counts = Dict{Int, Int}()
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    for number in numbers
        counts[number] = get(counts, number, 0) + 1
    end
    
    # Find the greatest integer with frequency greater than or equal to itself
    result = -1
    for (number, count) in counts
        if count >= number && number > result
            result = number
        end
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This implementation uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each number in the list. Then, it iterates over the counts and checks if the frequency is greater than or equal to the number itself. If it is, and the number is greater than the current result, it updates the result. Finally, it returns the result.
