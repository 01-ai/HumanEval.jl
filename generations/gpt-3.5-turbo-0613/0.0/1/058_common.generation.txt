Here is the implementation of the `common` function in Julia:

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    common_elements = intersect(l1, l2)
    return sort(unique(common_elements))
end
```

This function takes two vectors `l1` and `l2` as input and finds the common elements between them. It then returns a sorted vector of unique common elements.
