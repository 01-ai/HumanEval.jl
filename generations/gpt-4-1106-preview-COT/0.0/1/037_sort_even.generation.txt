To implement the `sort_even` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Extract the elements at even indices from the input vector `l`.
2. Sort the extracted elements.
3. Create a new vector `l_prime` that will hold the final result.
4. Iterate over the input vector `l` and for each index:
   - If the index is odd (considering 1-based indexing), copy the element from `l` to `l_prime`.
   - If the index is even, insert the next sorted element from step 2 into `l_prime`.
5. Return the resulting vector `l_prime`.

Now, let's write the code for the `sort_even` function following the outline above.
