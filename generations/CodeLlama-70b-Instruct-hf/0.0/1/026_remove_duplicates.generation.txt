function remove_duplicates(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Create a dictionary to store the count of each number
    count = Dict{Int, Int}()

    # Iterate through the numbers
    for num in numbers
        # If the number is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
        if !haskey(count, num)
            count[num] = 1
        # If the number is already in the dictionary, increment its count
        else
            count[num] += 1
        end
    end

    # Create an empty array to store the unique numbers
    unique_numbers = Int[]

    # Iterate through the numbers again
    for num in numbers
        # If the number's count is 1, add it to the unique numbers array
        if count[num] == 1

```

This function iterates through the input array twice. The first iteration counts the occurrences of each number using a dictionary. The second iteration adds the numbers with a count of 1 to a new array, preserving the original order.
