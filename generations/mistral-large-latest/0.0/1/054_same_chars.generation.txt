Sure, here is a Julia function that implements the `same_chars` function based on the given docstring:

```julia
function same_chars(s0::String, s1::String)::Bool
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.

    # Examples

    ```jldoctest
    julia> same_chars("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddeddabc")
    true

    julia> same_chars("abcd", "dddddddabc")
    true

    julia> same_chars("dddddddabc", "abcd")
    true

    julia> same_chars("eabcd", "dddddddabc")
    false

    julia> same_chars("abcd", "dddddddabce")
    false

    julia> same_chars("eabcdzzzz", "dddzzzzzzzddddabc")
    false
    ```
    """
    dict0 = Dict{Char, Int}()
    dict1 = Dict{Char, Int}()

    for char in s0
        if haskey(dict0, char)
            dict0[char] += 1
        else
            dict0[char] = 1
        end
    end

    for char in s1
        if haskey(dict1, char)
            dict1[char] += 1
        else
            dict1[char] = 1
        end
    end

    return dict0 == dict1
end
```

This function works by creating two dictionaries, one for each string, where the keys are the characters in the string and the values are the counts of each character. It then checks if these two dictionaries are equal, which means that the two strings have the same characters with the same frequencies.
