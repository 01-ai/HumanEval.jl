To implement the `circular_shift` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert the integer `x` to a string to easily manipulate its digits.
2. Determine the number of digits in `x` by calculating the length of the string.
3. If `shift` is greater than the number of digits, reverse the string and return it.
4. Otherwise, perform the circular shift:
   - Calculate the effective shift by taking the remainder of `shift` divided by the number of digits (to handle cases where `shift` is larger than the number of digits).
   - Split the string into two parts: one from the beginning to the length minus the shift, and the other from the length minus the shift to the end.
   - Concatenate the second part in front of the first part to achieve the circular shift.
5. Return the result as a string.

Now, let's write the code for the `circular_shift` function:

```julia
function circular_shift(x::Int, shift::Int)::String
    # Step 1: Convert the integer x to a string
    x_str = string(x)
    
    # Step 2: Determine the number of digits in x
    num_digits = length(x_str)
    
    # Step 3: If shift is greater than the number of digits, return reversed digits
    if shift >= num_digits
        return reverse(x_str)
    end
    
    # Step 4: Perform the circular shift
    effective_shift = shift % num_digits
    first_part = x_str[1:end-effective_shift]
    second_part = x_str[end-effective_shift+1:end]
    
    # Concatenate the second part in front of the first part
    result = second_part * first_part
    
    # Step 5: Return the result as a string
    return result
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(circular_shift(12, 1)) # Should print "21"
println(circular_shift(12, 2)) # Should print "12"
```

This code should work correctly for the given examples and specifications.
