  Here is a possible implementation of the `compare` function in Julia:
```
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    return abs.(game .- guess)
end
```
Explanation:

* The function takes two arguments: `game`, a vector of integers representing the actual scores, and `guess`, a vector of integers representing the guesses.
* The function returns a vector of integers of the same length as `game` and `guess`, where each element is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of `game` and `guess`.
* The `abs` function is used to compute the absolute difference between the elements of `game` and `guess`.
* The `.-` operator is used to compute the difference between the elements of `game` and `guess`.

Here are some examples of how the function can be used:
```
julia> compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2])
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 0

julia> compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2])
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
