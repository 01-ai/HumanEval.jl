Here's the Julia function `filter_by_prefix` that filters a list of strings based on a given prefix:

```julia
function filter_by_prefix(xs::Vector{String}, prefix::String)::Vector{String}
    # Use the `startswith` function to filter strings that start with the given prefix
    filter(x -> startswith(x, prefix), xs)
end
```

This function uses the `filter` function combined with the `startswith` function to select only those strings from the input vector `xs` that begin with the specified `prefix`. The `startswith` function checks if a string starts with a specified substring. The `filter` function applies this check to each element of the vector and returns a new vector containing only the elements that satisfy this condition.
