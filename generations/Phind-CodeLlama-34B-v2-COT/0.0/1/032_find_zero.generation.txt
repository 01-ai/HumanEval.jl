To implement the `find_zero` function, we can use the Newton-Raphson method, which is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations of the roots.

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Check if the length of `xs` is even and the largest coefficient is non-zero. If not, throw an error.
2. Initialize `x` to 0.
3. Start a loop that continues until the absolute value of `poly(x)` is less than a small tolerance (e.g., 1e-6).
4. In each iteration of the loop, update `x` using the Newton-Raphson method: `x = x - poly(x) / poly_derivative(x)`.
5. Return `x`.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function poly_derivative(xs::Vector, x::Float64)
    return sum(i * coeff * (x^(i - 1)) for (i, coeff) in enumerate(xs[2:end]))
end

function find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})
    if length(xs) % 2 != 0 || xs[end] == 0
        error("The input coefficients must have an even length and the largest coefficient must be non-zero.")
    end

    x = 0.0
    while abs(poly(xs, x)) > 1e-6
        x = x - poly(xs, x) / poly_derivative(xs, x)
    end

    return x
end
```

This code first defines a helper function `poly_derivative` that computes the derivative of a polynomial. Then it defines the main function `find_zero`, which checks the input conditions, initializes `x`, and repeatedly updates `x` using the Newton-Raphson method until `poly(x)` is close to 0.
