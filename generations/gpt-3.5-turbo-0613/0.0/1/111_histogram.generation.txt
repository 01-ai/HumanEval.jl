Here is the implementation for the `histogram` function in Julia:

```julia
function histogram(s::String)::Dict{String, Int}
    counts = Dict{String, Int}()
    for letter in split(s)
        counts[letter] = get(counts, letter, 0) + 1
    end
    
    max_count = maximum(values(counts))
    result = Dict{String, Int}()
    for (letter, count) in counts
        if count == max_count
            result[letter] = count
        end
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This function takes a string `s` as input and initializes an empty dictionary `counts` to store the count of each letter. It then iterates over each letter in the string, updating the count in the dictionary.

After counting the occurrences of each letter, it finds the maximum count using the `maximum` function. It then creates a new dictionary `result` and adds all letters with the maximum count to it.

Finally, it returns the `result` dictionary containing the letter(s) with the most repetition and their corresponding count.
