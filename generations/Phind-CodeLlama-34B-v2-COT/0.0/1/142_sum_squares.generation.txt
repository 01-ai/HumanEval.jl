Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize a variable `total` to 0. This will hold the sum of all modified entries in the list.
2. Iterate over the list with a for loop.
3. In each iteration, check if the index is a multiple of 3. If it is, square the value and add it to `total`. If it's not, check if it's a multiple of 4. If it is, cube the value and add it to `total`. If it's not a multiple of 3 or 4, just add the value to `total` without changing it.
4. After the loop, return `total`.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function sum_squares(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    total = 0
    for i in eachindex(xs)
        if i % 3 == 0
            total += xs[i]^2
        elseif i % 4 == 0
            total += xs[i]^3
        else
            total += xs[i]
        end
    end
    return total
end
```

This function works by iterating over the list `xs` and modifying each entry based on its index. The `total` variable keeps track of the sum of all modified entries. The function finally returns this sum.
