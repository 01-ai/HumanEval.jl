```julia
function unique_elements(l::Vector)
    # Sort the list
    sorted_list = sort(l)

    # Create an empty list to store unique elements
    unique_list = []

    # Iterate through the sorted list
    for i in sorted_list
        # Check if the current element is not in the unique list
        if !(i in unique_list)
            # Add the current element to the unique list
            push!(unique_list, i)
        end
    end

    # Return the unique list
    return unique_list
end
```

This function takes a list as input, sorts it, and then iterates through it to find unique elements. If an element is not already in the unique list, it is added to it. Finally, the unique list is returned.
