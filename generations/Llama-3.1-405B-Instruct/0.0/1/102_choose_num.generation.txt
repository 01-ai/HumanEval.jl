Here is the Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:

```julia
function choose_num(x::Int, y::Int)::Int
    # Check if the input range is valid
    if x > y
        return -1
    end

    # Find the largest even number in the range [x, y]
    largest_even = y - (y % 2)

    # If the largest even number is less than x, return -1
    if largest_even < x
        return -1
    else
        return largest_even
    end
end
```

This function first checks if the input range `[x, y]` is valid. If `x` is greater than `y`, it immediately returns `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the largest even number in the range by subtracting the remainder of `y` divided by 2 from `y`. If this largest even number is less than `x`, it means there is no even number in the range, so the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the largest even number.

You can test this function with the examples provided in the docstring:

```julia
julia> choose_num(12, 15)
14

julia> choose_num(13, 12)
-1
```
