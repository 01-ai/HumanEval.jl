To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array from both ends towards the center, comparing corresponding elements. If the elements are not the same, we increment a counter since at least one of them needs to be changed to make the array palindromic. The process stops when the iterators meet in the middle or pass each other. Here's how you can implement this in Julia:

```julia
function smallest_change(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Initialize a counter for the number of changes needed
    changes_needed = 0
    
    # Initialize pointers for the start and end of the array
    left = 1
    right = length(xs)
    
    # Iterate through the array from both ends towards the center
    while left < right
        # If the elements at the current pointers are not the same,
        # increment the counter
        if xs[left] != xs[right]
            changes_needed += 1
        end
        
        # Move the pointers towards the center
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    end
    
    # Return the total number of changes needed
    return changes_needed
end
```

This function works by comparing elements from both ends of the array and counting how many changes are needed to make the array palindromic. It efficiently solves the problem with a time complexity of O(n/2), where n is the length of the array, since it only needs to iterate through half of the array.
