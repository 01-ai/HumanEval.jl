function select_words(s::String, n::Int)::Vector{<:AbstractString}
    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)

    # Initialize an empty list to store the words with n consonants
    result = []

    # Iterate through each word
    for word in words
        # Initialize a counter for consonants
        consonants = 0

        # Iterate through each character in the word
        for char in word
            # Check if the character is a consonant
            if char != 'a' && char != 'e' && char != 'i' && char != 'o' && char != 'u'
                consonants += 1
            end
        end

        # If the number of consonants is equal to n, add the word to the result list
        if consonants == n
            push!(result, word)
        end
    end

    # Return the result list
    return result
end
```

This function splits the input string into words, iterates through each word, counts the number of consonants in each word, and adds the words with exactly `n` consonants to the result list.
