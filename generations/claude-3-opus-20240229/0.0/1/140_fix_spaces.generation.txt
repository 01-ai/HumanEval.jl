Here's the implementation of the `fix_spaces` function in Julia:

```julia
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # Replace all single spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")
    
    # Replace two or more consecutive spaces with a single hyphen
    s = replace(s, r"_{2,}" => "-")
    
    return s
end
```

Explanation:
1. The function takes a string `s` as input and returns a string.
2. The first step is to replace all single spaces in the string with underscores using the `replace` function. This is done by specifying the pattern `" "` (a single space) and the replacement `"_"` (an underscore).
3. The second step is to replace two or more consecutive underscores (which were previously spaces) with a single hyphen. This is done using a regular expression pattern `r"_{2,}"`, which matches two or more consecutive underscores. The replacement is set to `"-"` (a single hyphen).
4. Finally, the modified string is returned.

Here are some example usages of the `fix_spaces` function:

```julia
julia> fix_spaces("Example")
"Example"

julia> fix_spaces("Example 1")
"Example_1"

julia> fix_spaces(" Example 2")
"_Example_2"

julia> fix_spaces(" Example   3")
"_Example-3"
```

The function correctly replaces single spaces with underscores and multiple consecutive spaces with a single hyphen, as demonstrated in the examples.
