```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity
    s_lower = lowercase(s)
    
    # Create an empty set to store distinct characters
    distinct_chars = Set{Char}()
    
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s_lower
        # Add the character to the set. Duplicates are automatically ignored in a set.
        push!(distinct_chars, char)
    end
    
    # The size of the set gives the count of distinct characters
    return length(distinct_chars)
end
```
This function first converts the input string to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity. It then iterates through the characters, adding them to a set, which automatically ensures that only unique elements are stored. Finally, the function returns the size of the set, which is the count of distinct characters in the string.
