Here is a Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function do_algebra(operator::Vector{String}, operand::Vector{Int})
    result = operand[1]
    for i in 1:length(operator)
        if operator[i] == "+"
            result += operand[i+1]
        elseif operator[i] == "-"
            result -= operand[i+1]
        elseif operator[i] == "*"
            result *= operand[i+1]
        elseif operator[i] == "�"
            result �= operand[i+1]
        elseif operator[i] == "^"
            result ^= operand[i+1]
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function starts with the first operand as the result, then iterates over the operators and operands. For each operator, it performs the corresponding operation on the result and the next operand. The result is then returned.

Please note that the division operator "�" is used instead of "/" to avoid confusion with the Julia's division operator "/".

The function assumes that the input is valid, i.e., the length of the operator list is equal to the length of the operand list minus one, and that the operands are non-negative integers. If the input is not valid, the function may not work as expected.
