Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    count = 0
    for sentence in split(s, r"[.!?]")
        if startswith(strip(sentence), "I")
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function works by splitting the input string into sentences using the regular expression `r"[.!?]"`, which matches any character in the set `[.!?]`. It then checks each sentence to see if it starts with the word "I". If it does, it increments the count. The `strip` function is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the sentence.
