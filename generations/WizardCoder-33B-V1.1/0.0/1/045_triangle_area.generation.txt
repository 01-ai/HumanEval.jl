Here is the Julia function that calculates the area of a triangle:

```julia
function triangle_area(a, h)
    return 0.5 * a * h
end
```

This function takes two arguments: `a` and `h`. `a` is the length of a side of the triangle and `h` is the height of the triangle. The area of a triangle is calculated as 0.5 times the base times the height. The function returns this value.
