Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function count_upper(s::String)::Int
    count = 0
    vowels = "AEIOU"
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s)
        if i % 2 != 0 && char in vowels && isuppercase(char)
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the index of the character is odd, the character is an uppercase vowel, it increments the count. The function returns the count after iterating over all characters.
