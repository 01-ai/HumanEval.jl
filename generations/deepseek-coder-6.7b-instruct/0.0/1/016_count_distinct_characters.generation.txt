Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    return length(unique(lowercase(s)))
end
```

This function works by first converting the string to lowercase using the `lowercase` function, then using the `unique` function to get an array of unique characters, and finally using the `length` function to count the number of elements in this array.

You can test this function with the examples you provided:

```julia
julia> count_distinct_characters("xyzXYZ")
3

julia> count_distinct_characters("Jerry")
4
```

These will return `3` and `4` respectively, which are the number of distinct characters in the strings "xyzXYZ" and "Jerry".
