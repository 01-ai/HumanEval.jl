Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function max_element(xs)
    max_val = xs[1]
    for x in xs
        if x > max_val
            max_val = x
        end
    end
    return max_val
end
```

This function works by initializing `max_val` to the first element of the list, then iterating over the list, updating `max_val` whenever it encounters a larger element. At the end of the function, `max_val` will hold the maximum element in the list.
