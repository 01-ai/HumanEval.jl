### Step-by-Step Outline:

1. Define the function `fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int` that takes a string `s` and an integer `n`.
2. Parse the string `s` to extract the number of apples and oranges. This can be done by:
   - Splitting the string by spaces.
   - Identifying the elements that are digits and converting them to integers.
3. Calculate the number of mangoes by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits `n`.
4. Return the calculated number of mangoes.

### Julia Code:

```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Split the string by spaces
    parts = split(s)
    
    # Extract the number of apples and oranges
    num_apples = parse(Int, parts[1])
    num_oranges = parse(Int, parts[4])
    
    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    num_mangoes = n - num_apples - num_oranges
    
    return num_mangoes
end
```

Now, let's implement the function in Julia.
