This implementation uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from each cell in the grid. It recursively explores the grid, keeping track of the current path and backtracking when necessary. The function maintains a `min_seq` to store the lexicographically smallest path found so far and updates it whenever a smaller path is discovered. The solution ensures that the path is unique and lexicographically smallest as per the given conditions.
