Here is the Julia function for `decode_cyclic`:

```julia
function decode_cyclic(s::String)::String
    join((length(x) == 3 ? x[end] * x[1:2] : x for x in Iterators.partition(s, 3)))
end
```

This function works by partitioning the input string into groups of three characters. If a group has three characters, it reverses the order of the characters. If a group has less than three characters, it leaves the group as is. The `join` function is then used to combine the groups back into a single string.
