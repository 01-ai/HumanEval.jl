Here is the Julia function that implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers:

```julia
function greatest_common_divisor(a::Int, b::Int)::Int
    while b != 0
        a, b = b, a % b
    end
    return abs(a)
end
```

This function works by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` is 0. The greatest common divisor is then the last non-zero remainder. The `abs` function is used to ensure the result is always positive, even if one of the inputs was negative.
