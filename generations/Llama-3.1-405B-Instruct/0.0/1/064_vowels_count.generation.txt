Here is the Julia function that implements the `vowels_count` function as per the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    vowels_count(s::String)::Int

Write a function `vowels_count` which takes a string representing a word as
input and returns the number of vowels in the string. Vowels in this case are
'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' in both lower and upper cases. Here, 'y' or 'Y' is also
a vowel, but only when it is at the end of the given word.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> vowels_count("abcde")
2

julia> vowels_count("ACEDY")
3
```
"""
function vowels_count(s::String)::Int
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U']
    count = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(s)
        if c in vowels
            count += 1
        elseif (c == 'y' || c == 'Y') && i == length(s)
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), it increments the count. If the character is 'y' or 'Y' and it's at the end of the string, it also increments the count. Finally, it returns the total count of vowels.
