To implement the `correct_bracketing` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the balance of brackets.
2. Iterate over each character in the input string.
3. If the current character is an opening bracket `"("`, increment the counter.
4. If the current character is a closing bracket `")"`, decrement the counter.
5. If at any point the counter becomes negative, return `false` because a closing bracket has appeared without a corresponding opening bracket.
6. After the iteration, if the counter is zero, return `true` because all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets.
7. If the counter is not zero, return `false` because there are unmatched opening brackets.

Now, let's write the code for the function:

```julia
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    balance = 0
    for bracket in brackets
        if bracket == '('
            balance += 1
        elseif bracket == ')'
            balance -= 1
            if balance < 0
                return false
            end
        end
    end
    return balance == 0
end
```

This function will return `true` if the brackets are correctly balanced and `false` otherwise, as per the examples provided in the doc string.
