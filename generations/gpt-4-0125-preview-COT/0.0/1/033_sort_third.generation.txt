### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize an empty list for indices divisible by three**: Create an empty list to store the values of the original list `l` at indices that are divisible by three.

2. **Iterate through the original list `l`**: Loop through the list `l` using an index variable. For each element, check if the index (plus one, since Julia is 1-indexed) is divisible by three.

3. **Store values and indices of divisible elements**: If the condition in step 2 is true, append the value of the element at that index to the previously initialized list.

4. **Sort the list of divisible elements**: Sort the list that contains the values of elements at indices divisible by three.

5. **Re-insert the sorted values back into the original list**: Loop through the original list `l` again. For each element where the index (plus one) is divisible by three, replace the value at that index with the corresponding value from the sorted list.

6. **Return the modified original list**: After re-inserting the sorted values at the correct positions, return the modified list `l`.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty list for values at indices divisible by three
    divisible_values = []

    # Step 2 & 3: Iterate through `l` and store values at indices divisible by three
    for (index, value) in enumerate(l)
        if index % 3 == 0
            push!(divisible_values, value)
        end
    end

    # Step 4: Sort the list of divisible values
    sort!(divisible_values)

    # Step 5: Re-insert the sorted values back into `l`
    sorted_index = 1
    for index in 1:length(l)
        if index % 3 == 0
            l[index] = divisible_values[sorted_index]
            sorted_index += 1
        end
    end

    # Step 6: Return the modified list `l`
    return l
end
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps to modify the original list `l` according to the specified conditions, ensuring that only values at indices divisible by three are sorted and re-inserted into their original positions.
