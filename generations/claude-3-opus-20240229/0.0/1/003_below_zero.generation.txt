Here's an implementation of the `below_zero` function in Julia:

```julia
function below_zero(operations::Vector{Int})::Bool
    balance = 0
    for op in operations
        balance += op
        if balance < 0
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

Explanation:

1. The function takes a vector of integers `operations` as input.
2. We initialize a variable `balance` with a value of `0` to keep track of the account balance.
3. We iterate over each operation `op` in `operations`.
4. For each operation, we update the `balance` by adding the operation value (deposit or withdrawal).
5. If the `balance` becomes negative after an operation, we return `true` immediately, indicating that the balance fell below zero at some point.
6. If the loop completes without encountering a negative balance, we return `false`, indicating that the balance never fell below zero.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `operations` vector, as we need to iterate over all operations once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the `balance` variable.

Here are some test cases:

```jldoctest
julia> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
false

julia> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
true

julia> below_zero([-1, -2, -3])
true

julia> below_zero([])
false
```
