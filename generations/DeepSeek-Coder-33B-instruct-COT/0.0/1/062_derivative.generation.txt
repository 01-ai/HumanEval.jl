Here is a Julia function that implements the derivative function as described in the doc string.

```julia
function derivative(xs::Vector)::Vector
    n = length(xs)
    return [i * xs[i+1] for i in 1:n-1]
end
```

This function works by iterating over the indices of the input vector `xs` (excluding the first one, which is the constant term and doesn't contribute to the derivative). For each index `i`, it multiplies `i` by the coefficient `xs[i+1]` (since the derivative of `x^i` is `ix^(i-1)`), and stores the result in a new vector.

Here is how you can test this function:

```julia
julia> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
4-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  4
 12
 20

julia> derivative([1, 2, 3])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 6
```
