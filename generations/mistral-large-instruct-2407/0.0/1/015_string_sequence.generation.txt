 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `string_sequence` function in Julia based on the provided docstring:

```julia
"""
string_sequence(n::Int)::String

Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto `n`
inclusive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> string_sequence(0)
"0"

julia> string_sequence(5)
"0 1 2 3 4 5"
```
"""
function string_sequence(n::Int)::String
    return join(0:n, " ")
end
```

This function uses the `join` function to concatenate the numbers from 0 to `n` with a space delimiter. The `0:n` range creates an array of numbers from 0 to `n`, and `join` converts this array into a single string with each number separated by a space.
