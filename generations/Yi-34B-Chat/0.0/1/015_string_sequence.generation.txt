```julia
function string_sequence(n::Int)::String
    # Initialize an empty string
    result = ""

    # Loop over the range from 0 to n inclusive
    for i in 0:n
        # Append the current number to the result string
        result *= "$i "
    end

    # Remove the trailing space
    return result[1:end-1]
end
```

This function defines a `string_sequence` that takes an integer `n` and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive. It uses a for loop to iterate over the range from 0 to `n` and concatenates the numbers with a space in between. Finally, it removes the trailing space from the result string before returning it.
