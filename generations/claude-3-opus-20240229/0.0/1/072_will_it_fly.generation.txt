Here's a solution to the `will_it_fly` problem in Julia:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the object is balanced (palindromic)
    if q != reverse(q)
        return false
    end
    
    # Check if the sum of elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight
    if sum(q) > w
        return false
    end
    
    return true
end
```

Explanation:

1. The function `will_it_fly` takes two arguments: `q` (a vector of integers representing the object) and `w` (an integer representing the maximum possible weight).

2. First, we check if the object `q` is balanced, i.e., if it is a palindromic list. We compare `q` with its reverse using the `reverse` function. If they are not equal, it means the object is unbalanced, and we return `false`.

3. Next, we check if the sum of the elements in `q` is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. We use the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the elements. If the sum is greater than `w`, the object cannot fly, and we return `false`.

4. If both conditions are satisfied (the object is balanced and the sum of its elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight), we return `true` to indicate that the object will fly.

The function returns a Boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on whether the object will fly or not.

You can test the function with the given examples:

```julia
julia> will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)  # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.
false

julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)  # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.
false

julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)  # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
true

julia> will_it_fly([3], 5)  # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
true
```

The function should produce the expected results for the given examples.
