This function takes a vector of vectors `xs` and an integer `x` as input. It iterates over each row of the matrix, checking if `x` is present in the row. If `x` is found, it adds the coordinate (row index, column index) to the `coordinates` vector. After all rows have been checked, it sorts the `coordinates` vector by row index in ascending order. Finally, for each row, it sorts the coordinates by column index in descending order. The resulting vector of tuples is then returned.
