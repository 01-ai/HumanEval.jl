To implement the `bf` function as described, we first need to establish an ordered list of the planets according to their proximity to the Sun. Then, we can find the indices of the given planets in this list and return the planets that are between them. Here's how you can do it in Julia:

```julia
function bf(planet1::String, planet2::String)::NTuple
    # Ordered list of planets by their proximity to the Sun
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    
    # Find indices of the given planets
    index1 = findfirst(isequal(planet1), planets)
    index2 = findfirst(isequal(planet2), planets)
    
    # Check if both planets were found
    if isnothing(index1) || isnothing(index2)
        return ()
    end
    
    # Ensure index1 is less than index2 for correct slicing
    if index1 > index2
        index1, index2 = index2, index1
    end
    
    # Return the planets between the given two, excluding the start and end planets
    return Tuple(planets[index1+1:index2-1])
end
```

This function first defines the ordered list of planets. It then finds the indices of the input planets in this list. If either planet is not found, it returns an empty tuple. If the planets are found, it ensures the indices are in the correct order (from the Sun outward) before slicing the list to get the planets between the given two. Finally, it returns these planets as a tuple.
