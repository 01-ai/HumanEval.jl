### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Calculate the total number of characters in each list**:
   - Iterate through each string in the first list (`xs`) and sum up their lengths.
   - Repeat the process for the second list (`ys`).

2. **Compare the total number of characters**:
   - If the total number of characters in `xs` is less than in `ys`, return `xs`.
   - If the total number of characters in `ys` is less than in `xs`, return `ys`.
   - If the totals are equal, return `xs` as per the requirement.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Calculate the total number of characters in each list
    total_chars_xs = sum(length, xs)
    total_chars_ys = sum(length, ys)
    
    # Compare and return the appropriate list
    if total_chars_xs <= total_chars_ys
        return xs
    else
        return ys
    end
end
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps, ensuring that the function behaves as specified in the doc string, including handling edge cases such as empty lists.
