Here's a Julia function that solves the problem of matching parentheses as described:

```julia
function match_parens(lst::Vector{String})::String
    # Combine both strings
    combined = join(lst)
    
    # Count open and close parentheses
    open_count = count('(', combined)
    close_count = count(')', combined)
    
    # If the counts don't match, it's impossible to balance
    if open_count != close_count
        return "No"
    end
    
    # Check if it's possible to arrange them correctly
    open_available = open_count
    close_available = close_count
    open_needed = 0
    
    for char in combined
        if char == '('
            open_available -= 1
            open_needed += 1
        else  # char == ')'
            close_available -= 1
            if open_needed > 0
                open_needed -= 1
            else
                if open_available > 0
                    open_available -= 1
                    open_needed += 1
                else
                    return "No"
                end
            end
        end
    end
    
    return "Yes"
end
```

This function works as follows:

1. We first combine both strings in the input list.

2. We count the number of open and close parentheses in the combined string.

3. If the counts of open and close parentheses don't match, it's impossible to create a balanced string, so we return "No".

4. If the counts match, we simulate the process of arranging the parentheses:
   - We keep track of available open and close parentheses, and how many open parentheses we need at any point.
   - We iterate through the combined string:
     - For an open parenthesis, we decrease the available count and increase the needed count.
     - For a close parenthesis, we first try to match it with a needed open parenthesis. If there are no needed open parentheses, we try to use an available open parenthesis before it. If neither is possible, we return "No".

5. If we make it through the entire string without returning "No", it means a valid arrangement is possible, so we return "Yes".

This solution works because it checks if it's possible to rearrange the parentheses to create a valid string, without actually performing the rearrangement. It runs in O(n) time, where n is the total length of the input strings.
