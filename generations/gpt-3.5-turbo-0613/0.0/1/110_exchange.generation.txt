Here is the implementation for the `exchange` function:

```julia
function exchange(lst1::Vector{Int}, lst2::Vector{Int})::String
    # Count the number of odd numbers in lst1
    odd_count = count(x -> x % 2 != 0, lst1)
    
    # If lst1 already contains only even numbers, return "YES"
    if odd_count == 0
        return "YES"
    end
    
    # Count the number of even numbers in lst2
    even_count = count(x -> x % 2 == 0, lst2)
    
    # If there are enough even numbers in lst2 to exchange with odd numbers in lst1, return "YES"
    if even_count >= odd_count
        return "YES"
    end
    
    # Otherwise, return "NO"
    return "NO"
end
```

This function counts the number of odd numbers in `lst1` and checks if there are enough even numbers in `lst2` to exchange with the odd numbers in `lst1`. If there are enough even numbers, it returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO".
