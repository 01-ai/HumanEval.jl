    by_length(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{String}

Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9
inclusive, reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its
corresponding name from "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven",
"Eight", "Nine".

If the array is empty, return an empty array.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> by_length([2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3])  # sort & filtered: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8], reversed: [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
8-element Vector{String}:
 "Eight"
 "Five"
 "Four"
 "Three"
 "Two"
 "Two"
 "One"
 "One"

julia> by_length(Int[])
String[]

julia> by_length([1, -1, 55])  # sorte & filtered: [1], reversed: [1]
1-element Vector{String}:
 "One"
