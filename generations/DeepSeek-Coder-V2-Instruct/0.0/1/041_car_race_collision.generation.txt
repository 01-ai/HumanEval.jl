 To solve the problem of counting the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving towards each other on an infinitely long straight road, we can use a simple mathematical approach. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Setup**:
   - There are `n` cars moving left to right.
   - There are `n` cars moving right to left.
   - All cars move at the same speed.

2. **Collision Mechanism**:
   - A collision occurs when a car moving left to right meets a car moving right to left.
   - Since all cars move at the same speed, each car moving left to right will collide with each car moving right to left exactly once.

3. **Counting Collisions**:
   - Each of the `n` cars moving left to right will collide with each of the `n` cars moving right to left.
   - Therefore, the total number of collisions is simply the product of the number of cars in each set, which is `n * n`.

Given this understanding, the function can be implemented as follows:

```julia
function car_race_collision(n::Int)::Int
    return n * n
end
```

This function simply returns the square of the number of cars, which represents the total number of collisions.
