Here is a Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:
```julia
function is_nested(s::String)::Bool
    stack = []
    found_nested = false

    for c in s
        if c == '['
            if !isempty(stack)
                found_nested = true
            end
            push!(stack, c)
        elseif c == ']'
            if isempty(stack)
                return false
            end
            pop!(stack)
        end
    end

    return found_nested
end
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
2. We iterate through the input string character by character.
3. If we encounter an opening bracket `[`, we check if the stack is not empty. If it's not empty, it means we've found a nested bracket, so we set `found_nested` to `true`. We then push the opening bracket onto the stack.
4. If we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, it means there's no matching opening bracket, so we return `false`. Otherwise, we pop the opening bracket from the stack.
5. After iterating through the entire string, we return `found_nested`, which indicates whether we found a nested bracket or not.

You can test this function with the examples provided in the docstring to see that it produces the correct output.
