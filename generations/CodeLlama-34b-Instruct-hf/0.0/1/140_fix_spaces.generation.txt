  Here is a possible implementation of the `fix_spaces` function in Julia:
```
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # Replace all spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, " " => "_")
    # Replace consecutive spaces with a single dash
    s = replace(s, r" +" => "-")
    return s
end
```
Here, we first replace all spaces in the input string `s` with underscores using the `replace` function. We then use a regular expression to replace any consecutive spaces with a single dash. The regular expression `r" +"` matches one or more spaces, and the `replace` function replaces them with a single dash.

Note that the `r" +"` regular expression is used to match one or more spaces, so that we can replace consecutive spaces with a single dash. If we used a regular expression like `r" "` to match a single space, it would not match consecutive spaces and would not replace them with a dash.
