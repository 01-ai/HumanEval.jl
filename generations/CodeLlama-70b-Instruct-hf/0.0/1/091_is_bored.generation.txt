```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences
    sentences = split(s, r"[.!?]")

    # Initialize the count of boredoms
    boredoms = 0

    # Iterate through each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Trim leading and trailing whitespace
        sentence = strip(sentence)

        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if startswith(sentence, "I")
            boredoms += 1
        end
    end

    return boredoms
end
```

This function splits the input string into sentences using the `split` function and a regular expression that matches the punctuation characters `.`, `!`, and `?`. It then iterates through each sentence, strips leading and trailing whitespace, and checks if the sentence starts with the word "I". If it does, it increments the `boredom` count. Finally, it returns the total number of boredoms.
