To implement the `can_arrange` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable to store the largest index where the condition is met. We can call this variable `largest_index` and set it to -1 initially, as we assume no such element exists until we find one.

2. Iterate through the given vector `xs` starting from the second element (index 1) to the end of the vector.

3. For each element, compare it with the element immediately before it.

4. If the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous element, update `largest_index` with the current index.

5. After the loop, return the value of `largest_index`.

Now, let's write the code for the `can_arrange` function:

```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    largest_index = -1  # Step 1: Initialize the largest_index to -1
    
    # Step 2: Iterate through the vector starting from the second element
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        # Step 3: Compare the current element with the previous one
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            # Step 4: Update the largest_index if the condition is met
            largest_index = i
        end
    end
    
    # Step 5: Return the largest_index
    return largest_index
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly:

```julia
println(can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5]))  # Expected output: 4
println(can_arrange([1, 2, 3]))        # Expected output: -1
```
