Here's the implementation of the `correct_angle_bracketing` function in Julia:

```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets
        if char == '<'
            balance += 1
        elseif char == '>'
            balance -= 1
            if balance < 0
                return false
            end
        end
    end
    return balance == 0
end
```

This function uses a balance counter to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets. It increments the counter for each opening bracket `<` and decrements it for each closing bracket `>`. If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening ones up to that point, so the function returns `false`. Finally, the function returns `true` if the balance is zero at the end, indicating that all opening brackets have been matched by closing brackets.
