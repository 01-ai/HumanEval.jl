Here is a step-by-step outline of the algorithm:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to `false`.
2. Iterate over the list of numbers with two nested loops.
3. For each pair of numbers, calculate the absolute difference between them.
4. If the absolute difference is less than or equal to the threshold, set `result` to `true` and break the loops.
5. Return `result`.

Here is the Julia code implementing the above algorithm:

```julia
function has_close_elements(numbers::Vector{Float64}, threshold::Float64)::Bool
    result = false
    for i in 1:length(numbers)
        for j in i+1:length(numbers)
            if abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j]) <= threshold
                result = true
                break
            end
        end
        if result
            break
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function works by comparing each pair of numbers in the list. If it finds a pair that is closer than the threshold, it sets `result` to `true` and breaks the loops. If it doesn't find any such pair, it leaves `result` as `false`.
