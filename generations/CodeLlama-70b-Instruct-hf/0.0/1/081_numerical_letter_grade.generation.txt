            # Check if the numerical grade is greater than or equal to the boundary
            if grade >= boundary
                # Append the corresponding letter grade to the vector

                break
            end
        end

        # If no letter grade is found, append "E"
        if !found
            push!(letter_grades, "E")
        end
    end

    # Return the vector of letter grades
    return letter_grades
end
```

This function iterates through the numerical grades and compares them to the grade boundaries defined in a dictionary. If a numerical grade is greater than or equal to the boundary, it appends the corresponding letter grade to the vector. If no letter grade is found, it appends "E".
