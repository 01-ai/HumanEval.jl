Here's the implementation of the `bf` function in Julia:

```julia
function bf(planet1::String, planet2::String)::NTuple
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    
    # Find the indices of the given planets
    idx1 = findfirst(==("$(planet1)"), planets)
    idx2 = findfirst(==("$(planet2)"), planets)
    
    # Return an empty tuple if either planet name is incorrect
    if idx1 === nothing || idx2 === nothing
        return ()
    end
    
    # Ensure idx1 is less than idx2 for correct slicing
    if idx1 > idx2
        idx1, idx2 = idx2, idx1
    end
    
    # Get the planets between the two indices
    between_planets = planets[idx1+1:idx2-1]
    
    return tuple(between_planets...)
end
```

This function first defines the list of planets in order from the Sun. It then finds the indices of the given planets. If either planet name is incorrect, it returns an empty tuple. Otherwise, it ensures the indices are in the correct order and slices the list to get the planets between the two given planets. Finally, it converts the list to a tuple and returns it.
