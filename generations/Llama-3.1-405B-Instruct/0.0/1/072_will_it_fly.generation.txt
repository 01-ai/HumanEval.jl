Here is the Julia function that meets the requirements:
```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the vector is palindromic (balanced)
    is_palindromic = q == reverse(q)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the elements
    total_weight = sum(q)
    
    # Return true if the vector is palindromic and the sum is less than or equal to the maximum weight
    return is_palindromic && total_weight <= w
end
```
Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. We first check if the input vector `q` is palindromic by comparing it with its reverse using the `reverse` function. If they are equal, then the vector is palindromic.
2. We calculate the sum of the elements in the vector using the `sum` function.
3. We then return a boolean value indicating whether the vector is palindromic and the sum is less than or equal to the maximum weight `w`. We use the `&&` operator to combine the two conditions.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring:
```julia
julia> will_it_fly([1, 2], 5)
false

julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1)
false

julia> will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9)
true

julia> will_it_fly([3], 5)
true
```
