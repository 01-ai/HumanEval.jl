Sure, here's the implementation of the `mean_absolute_deviation` function in Julia:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    n = length(numbers)
    if n == 0
        return 0.0
    end
    mean_value = sum(numbers) / n
    mad = sum(abs.(numbers .- mean_value)) / n
    return mad
end
```

Let's break down the function:

1. **Calculate the mean**: First, we calculate the mean of the input numbers.
2. **Calculate the absolute deviations**: We then compute the absolute differences between each number and the mean.
3. **Compute the mean of these absolute deviations**: Finally, we take the average of these absolute deviations to get the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD).

Here's how the function works with the provided example:

```julia
julia> mean_absolute_deviation([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
1.0
```

This function will correctly compute the Mean Absolute Deviation for any vector of `Float64` numbers.
