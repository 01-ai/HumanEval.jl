Sure, here is the Julia function implementation based on your docstring:

```julia
function concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String
    return join(xs)
end
```

This function uses the `join` function from Julia's base library to concatenate the elements of the input vector `xs` into a single string. The `join` function concatenates the elements of an iterable with a specified delimiter, which is a empty string by default. This behavior matches the specified behavior in the docstring.
