Here's the implementation of the `correct_bracketing` function in Julia:

```julia
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    balance = 0
    for char in brackets
        if char == '('
            balance += 1
        elseif char == ')'
            balance -= 1
        end
        if balance < 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return balance == 0
end
```

This function uses a balance counter to keep track of the number of opening and closing brackets. It increments the counter for each opening bracket `(` and decrements it for each closing bracket `)`. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening ones up to that point, so the function returns `false`. Finally, the function returns `true` if the balance is zero at the end, indicating that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
