### Outline for Implementing `largest_divisor` Function

1. **Input Validation**: Check if the input `n` is an integer greater than 1. If not, return an appropriate message or value since every number is divisible by 1, and we are looking for the largest divisor smaller than `n`.

2. **Find the Largest Divisor**:
    - Start from `n - 1` and decrement down to 2 (inclusive), checking if `n` is divisible by the current number.
    - The first number found that divides `n` evenly is the largest divisor smaller than `n`.
    - Return this number.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: If no divisor other than 1 is found (which would be the case for prime numbers), return 1 as a special case.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function largest_divisor(n::Int)::Int
    # Step 1: Input validation
    if n <= 1
        error("Input must be greater than 1.")
    end
    
    # Step 2: Find the largest divisor
    for i in n-1:-1:2
        if n % i == 0
            return i  # Found the largest divisor smaller than n
        end
    end
    
    # Step 3: Handle edge case for prime numbers
    return 1  # If no divisor found, return 1 (for prime numbers)
end
```

This function iterates from `n-1` down to 2, checking for divisibility with `n`. It returns the first divisor found, which is the largest possible divisor smaller than `n`. If no such divisor is found (which would only happen for prime numbers), it returns 1.
