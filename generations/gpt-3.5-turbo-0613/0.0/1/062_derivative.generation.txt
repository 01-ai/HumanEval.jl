Here is the implementation for the `derivative` function:

```julia
function derivative(xs::Vector{T}) where T<:Number
    n = length(xs)
    derivative_xs = Vector{T}(undef, n-1)
    for i in 1:n-1
        derivative_xs[i] = xs[i+1] * i
    end
    derivative_xs
end
```

This function takes in a vector `xs` representing the coefficients of a polynomial and returns the derivative of the polynomial in the same form. It creates a new vector `derivative_xs` of length `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `xs`. Then, it iterates over the elements of `xs` from index 1 to `n-1` and calculates the derivative coefficient by multiplying the current coefficient with its corresponding power of `x`. Finally, it returns the `derivative_xs` vector.
