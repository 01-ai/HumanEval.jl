# Outline

1. Calculate the mean of the input numbers.
2. Subtract the mean from each number in the input list and calculate the absolute value.
3. Calculate the mean of these absolute differences.
4. Return this mean as the result.

# Code

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    # Calculate the mean of the input numbers
    mean_value = mean(numbers)

    # Subtract the mean from each number in the input list and calculate the absolute value
    absolute_differences = abs.(numbers .- mean_value)

    # Calculate the mean of these absolute differences
    mad = mean(absolute_differences)

    # Return the result
    return mad
end
```
