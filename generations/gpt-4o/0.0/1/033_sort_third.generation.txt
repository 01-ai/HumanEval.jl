Here's a Julia function that implements the `sort_third` functionality as described in the docstring:

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Extract the elements at indices divisible by 3
    third_elements = [l[i] for i in 1:length(l) if i % 3 == 0]
    
    # Sort these elements
    sorted_third_elements = sort(third_elements)
    
    # Create a copy of the original list to modify
    l_prime = copy(l)
    
    # Replace the elements at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted elements
    j = 1
    for i in 1:length(l)
        if i % 3 == 0
            l_prime[i] = sorted_third_elements[j]
            j += 1
        end
    end
    
    return l_prime
end

# Examples
println(sort_third([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
println(sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]))  # Output: [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
```

This function works as follows:
1. It extracts the elements at indices divisible by 3.
2. It sorts these extracted elements.
3. It creates a copy of the original list.
4. It replaces the elements at indices divisible by 3 in the copied list with the sorted elements.
5. It returns the modified list.
