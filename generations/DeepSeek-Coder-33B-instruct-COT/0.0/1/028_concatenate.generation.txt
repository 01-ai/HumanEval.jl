Here is the Julia function based on the given doc string:

```julia
function concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String
    return join(xs)
end
```

This function uses the `join` function from Julia's standard library to concatenate all the strings in the input vector into a single string. The `join` function takes an array of strings and concatenates them into a single string, with an optional separator string. In this case, we're not providing a separator, so `join` will simply concatenate all the strings together.

Here's how you can test this function:

```julia
julia> concatenate(String[])
""

julia> concatenate(["a", "b", "c"])
"abc"
```
