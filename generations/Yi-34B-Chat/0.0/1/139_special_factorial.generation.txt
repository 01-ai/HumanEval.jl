```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, the special factorial is 1
    if n <= 1
        return 1
    end

    # Calculate the factorial of n and each previous number
    factorials = [BigInt(i) for i in 1:n]
    result = factorials[n]
    for i in n-1:-1:1
        result *= factorials[i]
    end

    return result
end
```

This function calculates the Brazilian factorial of a positive integer `n` by multiplying together the factorials of `n` and all previous numbers down to 1. It uses a list comprehension to create a list of factorials, and then multiplies them together in a loop. The base case is handled by returning 1 if `n` is 0 or 1.
