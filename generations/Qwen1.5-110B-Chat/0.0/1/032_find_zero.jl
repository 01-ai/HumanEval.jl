    find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})

`xs` are coefficients of a polynomial. `find_zero` find `x` such that `poly(x) = 0`. `find_zero` returns only only zero point, even if there are many. Moreover,
`find_zero` only takes list xs having even number of coefficients and largest
non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> round(find_zero([1, 2]), digits = 1) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
-0.5

julia> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), digits = 1) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
1.0
```
