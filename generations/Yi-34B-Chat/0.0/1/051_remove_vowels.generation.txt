```julia
function remove_vowels(text::String)::String
    vowels = "aeiouy"
    result = ""
    for c in text
        if !(c in vowels)
            result *= c
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function defines a set of vowels and iterates over the input string, `text`, adding each character to the result string `result` if it is not a vowel. The `*=` operator is used to concatenate the characters to the result string. Finally, the result string is returned.
