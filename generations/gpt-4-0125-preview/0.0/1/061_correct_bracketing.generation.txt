To implement the `correct_bracketing` function in Julia, we can use a simple counter to keep track of the balance between opening and closing brackets. We increment the counter for every opening bracket "(" and decrement it for every closing bracket ")". If at any point the counter becomes negative, it means a closing bracket has appeared without a corresponding opening bracket before it, so we return `false`. If the counter is zero at the end of the string, it means every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, so we return `true`. If the counter is not zero at the end, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we return `false`.

Here's how you can implement it:

```julia
function correct_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    balance = 0
    for bracket in brackets
        if bracket == '('
            balance += 1
        elseif bracket == ')'
            balance -= 1
        end
        if balance < 0
            return false  # A closing bracket appears without an opening bracket
        end
    end
    return balance == 0  # True if balanced, false otherwise
end
```

This function iterates through each character in the input string, adjusting the balance based on whether the character is an opening or closing bracket and checking for correctness along the way.
