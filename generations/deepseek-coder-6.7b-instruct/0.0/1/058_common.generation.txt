Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    return sort(unique(intersect(l1, l2)))
end
```

This function uses the built-in `intersect` function to find common elements between two lists, `unique` to remove duplicates, and `sort` to sort the result.
