# Outline
1. Initialize a variable `max_idx` to -1. This will keep track of the largest index which satisfies the condition.
2. Iterate over the array `xs` with a loop.
3. In each iteration, check if the current element is less than the previous element.
4. If it is, update `max_idx` to the current index.
5. After the loop, return `max_idx`.

# Code
```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    max_idx = -1
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            max_idx = i
        end
    end
    return max_idx
end
```
