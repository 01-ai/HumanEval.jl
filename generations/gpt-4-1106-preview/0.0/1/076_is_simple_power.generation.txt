Certainly! Below is the Julia function `is_simple_power` that checks if `x` is a simple power of `n`:

```julia
function is_simple_power(x::Number, n::Number)::Bool
    # If n is 1, then x must be 1 to be a simple power of n
    if n == 1
        return x == 1
    end

    # If x is 0 or 1, it is a simple power of any n
    if x == 0 || x == 1
        return true
    end

    # If n is 0, x must be 0 to be a simple power of n
    if n == 0
        return x == 0
    end

    # Calculate the integer power that would give x if it exists
    power = log(x) / log(n)

    # Check if the calculated power is an integer and if n raised to that power equals x
    return isinteger(power) && n^round(Int, power) == x
end
```

This function uses logarithms to find the power and checks if it is an integer. If the power is an integer and `n` raised to that power equals `x`, the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

You can test the function with the provided examples to verify its correctness.
