# Outline

1. Initialize an empty Set to store distinct characters.
2. Convert the input string to lowercase to ignore case differences.
3. Iterate through each character in the string.
4. For each character, add it to the set. Since it's a set, duplicate characters will be ignored.
5. Return the length of the set, which represents the number of distinct characters.

# Code

```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    distinct_chars = Set{Char}()
    for c in lowercase(s)
        push!(distinct_chars, c)
    end
    return length(distinct_chars)
end
```

# Test

```julia
@assert count_distinct_characters("xyzXYZ") == 3
@assert count_distinct_characters("Jerry") == 4
```
