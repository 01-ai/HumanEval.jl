Here's the implementation of the `add` function in Julia based on the provided documentation:

```julia
function add(x::Int, y::Int)
    return x + y
end
```

Explanation:
- The function is named `add` and takes two parameters `x` and `y`.
- The types of both `x` and `y` are specified as `Int` using the `::` syntax, indicating that the function expects integers as input.
- Inside the function, we simply return the sum of `x` and `y` using the `+` operator.

The function behaves exactly as described in the documentation:

```jldoctest
julia> add(2, 3)
5

julia> add(5, 7)
12
```

The examples provided in the documentation serve as test cases to ensure the correct behavior of the `add` function.

This is a very basic example, but it demonstrates how to define a function in Julia with type annotations for the parameters and how to implement the desired functionality.
