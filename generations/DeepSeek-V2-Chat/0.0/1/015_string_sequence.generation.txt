Here's the implementation of the `string_sequence` function in Julia:

```julia
function string_sequence(n::Int)::String
    return join(0:n, " ")
end
```

This function uses the `join` function to concatenate the numbers from 0 to `n` with a space as the delimiter. The `0:n` range generates all the numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive.
