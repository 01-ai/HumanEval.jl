To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Intersection**: Determine the intersection of the two intervals. The intersection of two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] can be found as:
   - Start of intersection: `max(a, c)`
   - End of intersection: `min(b, d)`
   If the start of the intersection is greater than the end, then the intervals do not intersect.

2. **Calculate the Length of the Intersection**: If the intervals intersect, the length of the intersection is:
   - `end_intersection - start_intersection + 1`
   If this length is less than or equal to 1, it cannot be prime.

3. **Check for Primality**: If the length is greater than 1, check if it is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

4. **Return the Result**: If the length of the intersection is prime, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

Let's implement this in Julia:

```julia
function intersection(interval1::Vector{Int}, interval2::Vector{Int})::String
    # Extracting endpoints of the intervals
    a, b = interval1
    c, d = interval2
    
    # Calculate the intersection
    start_intersection = max(a, c)
    end_intersection = min(b, d)
    
    # Check if there is an intersection
    if start_intersection > end_intersection
        return "NO"
    end
    
    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    length_intersection = end_intersection - start_intersection + 1
    
    # Check if the length is a prime number
    if is_prime(length_intersection)
        return "YES"
    else
        return "NO"
    end
end

function is_prime(n::Int)::Bool
    if n <= 1
        return false
    end
    for i in 2:sqrt(n)
        if n % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

This function first checks if there is an intersection. If there is, it calculates the length of the intersection and checks if this length is a prime number using the helper function `is_prime`. If the length is prime, it returns "YES", otherwise "NO". If there is no intersection, it directly returns "NO".
