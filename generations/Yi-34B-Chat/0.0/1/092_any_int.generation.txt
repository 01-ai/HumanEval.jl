```julia
function any_int(x::Number, y::Number, z::Number)::Bool
    # Check if any of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two
    # and all numbers are integers.
    # If any of the numbers is not an integer, return false.
    # If all numbers are integers and one of them is equal to the sum of the other two,
    # return true.
    # If none of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, return false.
    # Note: You can assume that the numbers are not all equal to zero.
    
    # Your code here
    
    return true # Replace this with your actual implementation
end
```

This is a placeholder function with a docstring. To implement the function, you would need to write the actual logic that checks if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two, and all numbers are integers.
