 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `sum_product` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}

For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product
of all the integers in a list. Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product
should be equal to 1.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum_product(Int[])
(0, 1)

julia> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
(10, 24)
```
"""
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    if isempty(numbers)
        return (0, 1)
    end

    sum_val = 0
    product_val = 1

    for num in numbers
        sum_val += num
        product_val *= num
    end

    return (sum_val, product_val)
end
```

This function first checks if the input vector is empty. If it is, it returns `(0, 1)` as specified. Otherwise, it iterates through the vector to calculate the sum and product of the integers and returns them as a tuple.
