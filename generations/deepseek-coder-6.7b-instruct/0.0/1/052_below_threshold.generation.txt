Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function below_threshold(l::Vector, t::Number)::Bool
    for i in l
        if i >= t
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

This function iterates over each element in the vector `l`. If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to `t`, it immediately returns `false`. If it doesn't find any such element, it returns `true` after the loop finishes.
