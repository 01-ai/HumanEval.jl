Here is a Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:
```julia
function triples_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    sort!(l)
    
    # Iterate over the list
    for i in 1:length(l)-2
        # Skip duplicates to ensure distinct elements
        if i > 1 && l[i] == l[i-1]
            continue
        end
        
        # Initialize two pointers, one at the next element and one at the end
        left, right = i+1, length(l)
        
        while left < right
            # Calculate the sum of the three elements
            sum = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]
            
            # If the sum is zero, return true
            if sum == 0
                return true
            # If the sum is less than zero, move the left pointer to the right
            elseif sum < 0
                left += 1
            # If the sum is greater than zero, move the right pointer to the left
            else
                right -= 1
            end
        end
    end
    
    # If no triplets sum to zero, return false
    return false
end
```
This function uses a two-pointer technique to find triplets that sum to zero. It first sorts the list, then iterates over the list, skipping duplicates to ensure distinct elements. For each element, it initializes two pointers, one at the next element and one at the end of the list, and moves them towards each other until they meet or a triplet that sums to zero is found. If no such triplet is found, the function returns false.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring:
```julia
println(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0]))  # false
println(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1]))  # true
println(triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7]))  # false
println(triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7]))  # true
println(triples_sum_to_zero([1]))  # false
```
