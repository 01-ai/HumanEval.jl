### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Input Validation**: Check if the input `n` is less than 2. If so, return `false` because 1 and all negative numbers are not prime.
2. **Special Cases**: If `n` is 2 or 3, return `true` because these are the first two prime numbers.
3. **Efficient Prime Checking**:
    - Iterate from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The reason for only going up to the square root is that if `n` has a factor greater than its square root, then it must also have a smaller factor, and we would have already found it by then.
    - For each number `i` in this range, check if `n` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `n % i == 0`). If it is, then `n` is not prime, so return `false`.
4. **Return True**: If no divisors are found in the above steps, then `n` is prime, and we return `true`.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function is_prime(n::Int)
    # Step 1: Input validation
    if n < 2
        return false
    end

    # Step 2: Special cases
    if n == 2 || n == 3
        return true
    end

    # Step 3: Efficient prime checking
    for i in 2:isqrt(n)  # isqrt(n) computes the integer square root of n
        if n % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end

    # Step 4: Return true if no divisors found
    return true
end
```

This implementation efficiently checks if a number is prime by reducing the number of checks needed, especially for large numbers, by only iterating up to the square root of the number.
