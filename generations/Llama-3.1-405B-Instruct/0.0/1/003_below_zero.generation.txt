Here is the Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:
```julia
function below_zero(operations::Vector{Int})::Bool
    balance = 0
    for op in operations
        balance += op
        if balance < 0
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We initialize the `balance` variable to 0, representing the initial balance of the account.
* We iterate over each operation in the `operations` vector.
* For each operation, we add the operation value to the `balance`. If the operation is a deposit, this will increase the balance, and if it's a withdrawal, this will decrease the balance.
* We check if the updated `balance` is less than 0. If it is, we immediately return `true`, indicating that the balance fell below zero at some point.
* If we complete the iteration over all operations without the balance falling below zero, we return `false`.

You can test this function with the examples provided in the docstring to verify its behavior:
```julia
julia> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
false

julia> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
true
```
