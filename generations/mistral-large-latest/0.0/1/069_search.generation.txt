Sure, here is a Julia function that implements the described behavior:

```julia
function search(numbers::Vector{Int})::Int
    count_dict = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for number in numbers
        if haskey(count_dict, number)
            count_dict[number] += 1
        else
            count_dict[number] = 1
        end
    end
    max_value = -1
    for (key, value) in count_dict
        if key <= value && key > max_value
            max_value = key
        end
    end
    return max_value
end
```

This function first creates a dictionary to count the frequency of each number in the input vector. Then it iterates over the dictionary to find the maximum number that is less than or equal to its frequency. If no such number is found, it returns -1.
