```julia
function vowels_count(s::String)::Int
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOUY"
    count = 0
    for char in s
        if char in vowels
            count += 1
        end
    end
    if endswith(s, 'y') || endswith(s, 'Y')
        count += 1
    end
    return count
end
```

This Julia function `vowels_count` iterates over each character in the input string `s`. If the character is found in the `vowels` string, it increments the `count`. It also checks if the last character is 'y' or 'Y' and increments the count if true, adhering to the specific rule for 'y' being a vowel only at the end of the word.
