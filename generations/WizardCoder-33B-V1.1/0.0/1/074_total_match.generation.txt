Here is the Julia function that implements the above doc string:

```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    if sum(length.(xs)) < sum(length.(ys))
        return xs
    else
        return ys
    end
end
```

This function works by summing the lengths of all strings in each list and comparing the sums. If the sum of the lengths of `xs` is less than the sum of the lengths of `ys`, it returns `xs`; otherwise, it returns `ys`.
