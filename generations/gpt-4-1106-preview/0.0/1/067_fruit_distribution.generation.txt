Here is the Julia function `fruit_distribution` that implements the logic described in the doc string:

```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Extract the number of apples and oranges from the string
    apple_count = parse(Int, match(r"\d+(?= apples)", s).match)
    orange_count = parse(Int, match(r"\d+(?= oranges)", s).match)
    
    # Calculate the number of mangoes by subtracting the number of apples and oranges from the total
    mango_count = n - apple_count - orange_count
    
    return mango_count
end
```

You can test this function with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.
