Here is a step-by-step outline of how you can implement the function `f`:

1. Initialize an empty vector `result` of size `n`.
2. Iterate over the range from 1 to `n`.
3. For each `i`, check if `i` is even.
4. If `i` is even, calculate the factorial of `i` and append it to `result`.
5. If `i` is not even, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` and append it to `result`.
6. Return `result`.

Here is the Julia code that implements the above steps:

```julia
function f(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    result = Vector{Int}(undef, n)
    for i in 1:n
        if i % 2 == 0
            result[i] = factorial(i)
        else
            result[i] = sum(1:i)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function uses the `factorial` function from the `Base` module to calculate the factorial of a number, and the `sum` function to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to `i`. The `%` operator is used to check if `i` is even.
