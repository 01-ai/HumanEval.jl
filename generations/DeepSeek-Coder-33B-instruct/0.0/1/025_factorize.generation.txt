Here is a Julia function that implements the factorization of an integer:

```julia
function factorize(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    factors = Int[]
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n
        while n % i == 0
            pushfirst(factors, i)
            n = n ï¿½ i
        end
        i += 1
    end
    if n > 1
        pushfirst(factors, n)
    end
    return reverse(factors)
end
```

This function works by repeatedly dividing the input number `n` by increasing integers starting from 2. If `n` is divisible by the current integer, it is added to the list of factors and `n` is updated to be the result of the division. This process continues until `n` is no longer divisible by the current integer. The function then increments the current integer and repeats the process. If `n` is greater than 1 after all divisors have been checked, it is added to the list of factors. The function finally returns the list of factors in reverse order.

This function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)) because it checks divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
