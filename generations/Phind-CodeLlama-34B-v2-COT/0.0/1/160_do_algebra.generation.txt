To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to the first operand.
2. Iterate over the operators and operands simultaneously using a for loop.
3. For each operator and the corresponding operands, perform the operation and update `result`.
4. Return `result` after the loop finishes.

Here is the Julia code that implements this algorithm:

```julia
function do_algebra(operator::Vector{String}, operand::Vector{Int})
    # Initialize result to the first operand
    result = operand[1]

    # Iterate over the operators and operands simultaneously
    for (op, num) in zip(operator, operand[2:end])
        # Perform the operation and update result
        if op == "+"
            result += num
        elseif op == "-"
            result -= num
        elseif op == "*"
            result *= num
        elseif op == "รท"
            result รท= num
        elseif op == "^"
            result ^= num
        end
    end

    # Return the final result
    return result
end
```

This function works by first initializing `result` to the first operand. Then, it iterates over the operators and operands simultaneously using the `zip` function. For each operator and the corresponding operand, it performs the operation and updates `result`. Finally, it returns `result` after the loop finishes.
