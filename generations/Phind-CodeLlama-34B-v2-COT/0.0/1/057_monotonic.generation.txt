```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    # Step 1: Initialize a flag for increasing (inc) and decreasing (dec)
    inc, dec = true, true

    # Step 2: Iterate over the list and check for increasing and decreasing
    for i in 2:length(l)
        if l[i] > l[i-1]
            dec = false
        elseif l[i] < l[i-1]
            inc = false
        end
    end

    # Step 3: Return true if list is either increasing or decreasing
    return inc || dec
end
```

This function works by initializing two Boolean flags, `inc` and `dec`, to `true`. It then iterates over the list `l`, updating the flags as follows:

- If the current element is greater than the previous one, it sets `dec` to `false`.
- If the current element is less than the previous one, it sets `inc` to `false`.

Finally, it returns the logical OR of `inc` and `dec`. If either flag is `true`, it means that the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing, so the function returns `true`. If both flags are `false`, it means that the list is not monotonically increasing or decreasing, so the function returns `false`.
