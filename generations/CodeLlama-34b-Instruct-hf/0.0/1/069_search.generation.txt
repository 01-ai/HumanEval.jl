  Here is a possible implementation of the `search` function in Julia:
```
function search(numbers::Vector)::Int
    # Create a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each integer
    freq = Dict{Int, Int}()
    for num in numbers
        freq[num] = get(freq, num, 0) + 1
    end

    # Find the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value
    max_freq = -1
    for (num, freq) in freq
        if freq >= num && freq > max_freq
            max_freq = freq
        end
    end

    # Return the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value, or -1 if no such integer exists
    return max_freq == -1 ? -1 : max_freq
end
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. First, we create a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the input list. We use the `get` function to initialize the frequency of each integer to 0, and then we increment the frequency of each integer as we encounter it in the list.
2. Next, we find the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value. We do this by iterating over the dictionary `freq` and keeping track of the maximum frequency that we've seen so far. If we encounter an integer with a frequency greater than or equal to its value, we update the maximum frequency and the corresponding integer.
3. Finally, we return the greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value, or -1 if no such integer exists.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

* In the first example, the input list is `[4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]`. The frequency of each integer is:
	+ 4: 2
	+ 1: 2
	+ 2: 2
	+ 3: 1
	+ 1: 1

The greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value is 2, which has a frequency of 2. Therefore, the function returns 2.

* In the second example, the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]`. The frequency of each integer is:
	+ 1: 1
	+ 2: 2
	+ 3: 3
	+ 4: 3

The greatest integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value is 3, which has a frequency of 3. Therefore, the function returns 3.

* In the third example, the input list is `[5, 5, 4, 4, 4]`. The frequency of each integer is:
	+ 5: 2
	+ 4: 3

There is no integer that has a frequency greater than or equal to its value, so the function returns -1.
