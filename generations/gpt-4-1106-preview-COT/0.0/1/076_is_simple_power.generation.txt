To implement the `is_simple_power` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Check if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, return `false` because a non-positive exponent cannot produce a positive integer result.
2. If `x` is 1, return `true` because any number to the power of 0 is 1.
3. If `n` is 1 and `x` is not 1, return `false` because 1 to any power is always 1.
4. Calculate the `n`th root of `x` using the appropriate Julia function.
5. Check if the `n`th root is an integer by comparing it to its floor value.
6. If the `n`th root is an integer, raise it to the power of `n` and check if the result equals `x`.
7. Return `true` if the result equals `x`, otherwise return `false`.

Now, let's write the code for the function:

```julia
function is_simple_power(x::Number, n::Number)::Bool
    # Step 1: Check if n is less than or equal to 0
    if n <= 0
        return false
    end
    
    # Step 2: Check if x is 1
    if x == 1
        return true
    end
    
    # Step 3: Check if n is 1 and x is not 1
    if n == 1 && x != 1
        return false
    end
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the nth root of x
    nth_root = x^(1/n)
    
    # Step 5: Check if the nth root is an integer
    if nth_root == floor(nth_root)
        # Step 6: Check if raising the nth root to the power of n equals x
        return nth_root^n == x
    end
    
    # Step 7: Return false if nth root is not an integer
    return false
end
```

Please note that the `^(1/n)` operation might introduce floating-point errors, so the comparison in step 6 might not be exact. If necessary, we could introduce a tolerance level to account for floating-point inaccuracies. However, for the sake of this example, we will assume that the inputs and the operation are precise enough not to require this.
