  Here's one way to implement the `sort_third` function in Julia:
```
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    l_sorted = sort(l)
    l_third = similar(l)
    for i in 1:length(l)
        if i % 3 == 0
            l_third[i] = l_sorted[i]
        else
            l_third[i] = l[i]
        end
    end
    return l_third
end
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. First, we sort the input vector `l` using the `sort` function. This gives us a sorted version of `l`, which we store in `l_sorted`.
2. Next, we create a new vector `l_third` that is the same size as `l`.
3. We then iterate over the elements of `l` and check if the current index `i` is divisible by 3. If it is, we set the corresponding element of `l_third` to the value of the corresponding element of `l_sorted`. If it's not, we set the corresponding element of `l_third` to the value of the corresponding element of `l`.
4. Finally, we return `l_third`.

Here's an example of how to use the `sort_third` function:
```
julia> l = [5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2]
7-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 6
 3
 4
 8
 9
 2

julia> sort_third(l)
7-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 6
 3
 4
 8
 9
 2
```
As you can see, the function returns a vector that is identical to `l` in the indices that are not divisible by 3, while its values at the indices that are divisible by 3 are equal to the values of the corresponding indices of `l`, but sorted.
