Sure, here is the Julia function that implements the given docstring:

```julia
function numerical_letter_grade(grades::Vector{Float64})::Vector{String}
    letter_grades = Vector{String}(undef, length(grades))

    for (i, grade) in enumerate(grades)
        if grade > 4.0
            letter_grades[i] = "A+"
        elseif grade > 3.7
            letter_grades[i] = "A"
        elseif grade > 3.3
            letter_grades[i] = "A-"
        elseif grade > 3.0
            letter_grades[i] = "B+"
        elseif grade > 2.7
            letter_grades[i] = "B"
        elseif grade > 2.3
            letter_grades[i] = "B-"
        elseif grade > 2.0
            letter_grades[i] = "C+"
        elseif grade > 1.7
            letter_grades[i] = "C"
        elseif grade > 1.3
            letter_grades[i] = "C-"
        elseif grade > 1.0
            letter_grades[i] = "D+"
        elseif grade > 0.7
            letter_grades[i] = "D"
        elseif grade > 0.0
            letter_grades[i] = "D-"
        else
            letter_grades[i] = "E"
        end
    end

    return letter_grades
end
```

This function takes a vector of Floating point numbers representing the GPA of students and returns a vector of String representing the corresponding letter grades. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each GPA in the input vector and uses if-elseif-else statements to determine the corresponding letter grade based on the given table. The resulting letter grades are stored in a vector which is returned at the end of the function.
