```julia
function sum_squares(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    n = length(xs)
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:n
        if i % 3 == 0
            sum += xs[i]^2
        elseif i % 4 == 0
            sum += xs[i]^3
        else
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

Note: The index in Julia starts from 1, not 0. So, the index i is a multiple of 3 or 4, not i-1. Also, the function name "sum" is a built-in function in Julia, so it's better to avoid using it as a variable name.
