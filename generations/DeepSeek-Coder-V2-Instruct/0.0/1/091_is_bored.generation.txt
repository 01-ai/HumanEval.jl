 Here's the implementation of the `is_bored` function in Julia:

```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences based on '.', '?' or '!'
    sentences = split(s, r"[.!?]")
    
    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Trim leading and trailing whitespace from the sentence
        trimmed_sentence = strip(sentence)
        
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if startswith(lowercase(trimmed_sentence), "i ")
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end
    
    return boredom_count
end
```

This function works as follows:
1. It splits the input string into sentences using the delimiters `.`, `?`, and `!`.
2. It initializes a counter to keep track of the number of boredoms.
3. It iterates over each sentence, trims any leading or trailing whitespace, and checks if the sentence starts with the word "I" (case-insensitive).
4. If a sentence starts with "I", it increments the boredom counter.
5. Finally, it returns the count of boredoms.
