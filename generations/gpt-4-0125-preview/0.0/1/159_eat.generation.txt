```julia
function eat(number::Int, need::Int, remaining::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Calculate the total number of carrots to be eaten
    total_eaten = number + min(need, remaining)
    
    # Calculate the number of carrots left after eating
    carrots_left = max(0, remaining - need)
    
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
end
```

This Julia function `eat` takes three integer inputs: the number of carrots already eaten (`number`), the number of carrots needed to eat (`need`), and the number of remaining carrots (`remaining`). It calculates the total number of carrots eaten after satisfying the need (or eating as many as possible if the need exceeds the remaining carrots) and the number of carrots left. It returns these two values in a vector.
