  Here's an implementation of the `encrypt` function in Julia based on the given doc string:
```julia
function encrypt(s::String)
    # Create a new string with the same length as the input string
    encrypted = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for c in s
        # Get the index of the character in the alphabet
        index = findfirst(c, 'a':'z')

        # If the character is not found in the alphabet, return the original character
        if index == 0
            encrypted *= c
        else
            # Rotate the character by two places
            new_index = (index + 2) % 26

            # Get the new character from the alphabet
            new_char = 'a' + new_index

            # Add the new character to the encrypted string
            encrypted *= new_char
        end
    end

    return encrypted
end
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. The function takes a string `s` as input and creates a new string `encrypted` with the same length as `s`.
2. The function iterates over each character in `s` using a `for` loop.
3. For each character `c` in `s`, the function first checks if `c` is in the alphabet by using the `findfirst` function. If `c` is not found in the alphabet, the function returns the original character.
4. If `c` is found in the alphabet, the function rotates the character by two places by adding 2 to its index in the alphabet. The new index is then used to get the new character from the alphabet.
5. The new character is then added to the `encrypted` string.
6. The function returns the `encrypted` string.

Here are some examples of how the function works:

* `encrypt("hi")` returns `"lm"` because `h` is rotated by 2 places to `l` and `i` is rotated by 2 places to `m`.
* `encrypt("asdfghjkl")` returns `"ewhjklnop"` because each character is rotated by 2 places.
* `encrypt("gf")` returns `"kj"` because `g` is rotated by 2 places to `k` and `f` is rotated by 2 places to `j`.
* `encrypt("et")` returns `"ix"` because `e` is rotated by 2 places to `i` and `t` is rotated by 2 places to `x`.
