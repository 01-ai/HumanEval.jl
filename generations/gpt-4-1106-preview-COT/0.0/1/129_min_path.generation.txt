To implement the `min_path` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `min_path` with the appropriate signature.
2. Initialize a variable to store the minimum path found so far.
3. Create a helper function to explore the grid from a given cell, keeping track of the current path and its length.
4. In the helper function, check if the current path length equals `k`. If so, compare it lexicographically with the minimum path found so far and update the minimum path if necessary.
5. If the current path length is less than `k`, explore all valid neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) that are within the grid boundaries.
6. For each neighbor, recursively call the helper function with the updated path and path length.
7. After exploring all possible paths, return the minimum path found.

Now, let's write the code for the `min_path` function.
