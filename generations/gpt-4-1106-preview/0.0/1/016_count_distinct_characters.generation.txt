Certainly! Below is the Julia function `count_distinct_characters` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of distinct characters, ignoring case:

```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    # Convert the string to lowercase to ignore case
    lower_s = lowercase(s)
    # Create a set to store distinct characters
    distinct_chars = Set{Char}()
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for c in lower_s
        # Add the character to the set
        push!(distinct_chars, c)
    end
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return length(distinct_chars)
end

# Examples
println(count_distinct_characters("xyzXYZ")) # Output: 3
println(count_distinct_characters("Jerry"))  # Output: 4
```

This function uses a `Set` to keep track of distinct characters. Since sets do not allow duplicate elements, adding characters to the set will automatically ensure that only distinct characters are counted. Converting the string to lowercase before processing ensures that the function is case-insensitive.
