To implement the `sort_even` function as described, we need to follow these steps:

1. Extract the elements at even indices from the input list.
2. Sort the extracted elements.
3. Replace the elements at even indices in the original list with the sorted elements.

In Julia, indexing is 1-based, so even indices from a 1-based perspective are actually odd indices in a 0-based perspective (like Python). Here's how you can implement the function:

```julia
function sort_even(l::Vector)::Vector
    # Extract elements at even indices (1-based indexing)
    even_indices_elements = [l[i] for i in 2:2:length(l)]
    
    # Sort the extracted elements
    sorted_even_indices_elements = sort(even_indices_elements)
    
    # Replace elements at even indices with sorted elements
    l_prime = copy(l) # Create a copy to modify and return
    j = 1 # Index for sorted_even_indices_elements
    for i in 2:2:length(l)
        l_prime[i] = sorted_even_indices_elements[j]
        j += 1
    end
    
    return l_prime
end
```

This function works as follows:
- It first creates a list of elements that are at even indices in the input list `l`.
- Then, it sorts this list.
- After that, it iterates over the even indices of the original list and replaces the elements at these indices with the sorted elements.
- Finally, it returns the modified list `l_prime` which has the same elements at odd indices as the original list but sorted elements at even indices.
