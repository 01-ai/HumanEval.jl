```julia
function change_base(x::Int, base::Int)::String
    if base < 2 || base > 9
        throw(ArgumentError("Base must be between 2 and 9"))
    end

    result = ""
    while x > 0
        remainder = x % base
        result = string(remainder) * result
        x = x รท base
    end

    return result == "" ? "0" : result
end
```

This function `change_base` takes an integer `x` and a `base` and converts the number `x` from base 10 to the specified `base`. The function checks if the base is between 2 and 9, computes the remainder when `x` is divided by `base`, prepends it to the result string, and then updates `x` by integer division with `base`. The loop continues until `x` becomes zero. If the result string is empty (which happens if `x` is 0), it returns "0". Otherwise, it returns the result string which is the representation of the original number in the new base.
