```julia
function order_by_points(nums::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Create a dictionary to store the sum of digits of each number
    sum_dict = Dict{Int, Int}()

    # Calculate the sum of digits for each number
    for num in nums
        sum_dict[num] = sum(digits(num))
    end

    # Sort the numbers based on their sum of digits
    sorted_nums = sort(nums, by=x -> sum_dict[x])

    return sorted_nums
end
```

This function first creates a dictionary to store the sum of digits of each number in the given list. Then, it calculates the sum of digits for each number and stores it in the dictionary. Finally, it sorts the numbers based on their sum of digits and returns the sorted list.
