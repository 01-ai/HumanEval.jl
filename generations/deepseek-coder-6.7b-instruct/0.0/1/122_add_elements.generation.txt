Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    return sum(x for x in xs[1:k] if length(string(abs(x))) <= 2)
end
```

This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the first `k` elements of `xs`. The `string(abs(x))` expression converts each number to a string, and `length()` counts the number of digits in the string. If the number of digits is less than or equal to 2, the number is included in the sum. The `abs()` function is used to handle negative numbers.
