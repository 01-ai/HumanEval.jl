Here's the implementation of the `fruit_distribution` function in Julia:

```julia
function fruit_distribution(s::String, n::Int)::Int
    # Split the string into parts
    parts = split(s, " ")
    
    # Extract the number of apples and oranges
    apples = parse(Int, parts[1])
    oranges = parse(Int, parts[4])
    
    # Calculate the number of mangoes
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges
    
    return mangoes
end
```

This function works by splitting the input string into parts, parsing the number of apples and oranges, and then subtracting these from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.
