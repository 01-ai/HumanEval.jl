Here is a step-by-step outline of how to implement the `special_factorial` function in Julia:

1. Define a function `special_factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Initialize a variable `result` to 1.
3. Use a for loop to iterate from `n` down to 1.
4. In each iteration, multiply `result` by the factorial of the current number.
5. Return `result`.

Here is the Julia code that implements this outline:

```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    result = BigInt(1)
    for i in n:-1:1
        result *= factorial(i)
    end
    return result
end
```

This function uses the `factorial` function from the `Base` module to calculate the factorial of a number. The `factorial` function returns an `Int`, so we need to convert `result` to `BigInt` before the loop to avoid overflow.

You can test the function with the following code:

```julia
println(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
```
