Here is a step-by-step outline of how to solve this problem:

1. Initialize a counter to 0. This counter will keep track of the number of times the digit 7 appears in numbers divisible by 11 or 13.

2. Iterate over the numbers from 1 to `n`.

3. For each number, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, convert the number to a string and count the number of times the digit 7 appears in the string. Add this count to the counter.

4. Return the counter.

Here is the Julia code that implements this algorithm:

```julia
function fizz_buzz(n::Int)
    count = 0
    for i in 1:n
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0
            count += count_sevens(string(i))
        end
    end
    return count
end

function count_sevens(s::String)
    return count(c -> c == '7', s)
end
```

In this code, `fizz_buzz` is the main function that implements the algorithm described above. It uses a helper function `count_sevens` to count the number of times the digit 7 appears in a string. The `count` function is used with a predicate that checks if a character is equal to '7'.
