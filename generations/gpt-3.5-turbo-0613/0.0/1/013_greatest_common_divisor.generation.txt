Here is the implementation of the `greatest_common_divisor` function in Julia:

```julia
function greatest_common_divisor(a::Int, b::Int)::Int
    while b != 0
        a, b = b, a % b
    end
    return abs(a)
end
```

This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`. It repeatedly divides `a` by `b` and updates `a` and `b` until `b` becomes zero. The final value of `a` is the greatest common divisor. The `abs` function is used to ensure that the result is always positive.
