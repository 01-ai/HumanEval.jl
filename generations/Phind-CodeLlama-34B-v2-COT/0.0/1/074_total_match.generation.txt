Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Define a function `total_match` that takes two arguments, `xs` and `ys`, both of which are vectors of strings.
2. Calculate the total number of characters in all strings of `xs` and `ys` using a function `total_chars`.
3. Compare the total number of characters of `xs` and `ys` and return the list with less total characters.
4. If the total number of characters is equal, return `xs`.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    total_chars(strs::Vector{String}) = sum(length(s) for s in strs)

    chars_xs = total_chars(xs)
    chars_ys = total_chars(ys)

    if chars_xs <= chars_ys
        return xs
    else
        return ys
    end
end
```

This function first calculates the total number of characters in all strings of `xs` and `ys` using the `total_chars` function. Then it compares the total number of characters of `xs` and `ys` and returns the list with less total characters. If the total number of characters is equal, it returns `xs`.
