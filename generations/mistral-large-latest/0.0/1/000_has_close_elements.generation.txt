Sure, here is the Julia function that fulfills the requirements:

```julia
function has_close_elements(numbers::Vector{Float64}, threshold::Float64)::Bool
    sort!(numbers)
    for i in 1:(length(numbers)-1)
        if numbers[i+1] - numbers[i] < threshold
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This function first sorts the input vector of numbers. Then it iterates over the sorted vector and checks the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers. If the difference is less than the given threshold, it returns true. If no such pair is found, it returns false.
