Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the smallest even value and its index.
2. Iterate over the input array.
3. For each element, check if it is even.
4. If it is even, check if it is smaller than the current smallest even value (or if this is the first even number being checked).
5. If it is the smallest even number, update the smallest even value and its index.
6. After iterating over all elements, return the smallest even value and its index (or an empty list if no even numbers were found).

Here is the Julia code implementing the above outline:

```julia
function pluck(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    smallest_even = typemax(Int)
    smallest_index = 0

    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        if x % 2 == 0 && x < smallest_even
            smallest_even = x
            smallest_index = i
        end
    end

    if smallest_index == 0
        return Int[]
    else
        return [smallest_even, smallest_index]
    end
end
```

This function works by initializing `smallest_even` to the maximum possible `Int` value and `smallest_index` to 0. It then iterates over the input array, checking each element to see if it is even and smaller than the current smallest even number. If it is, it updates `smallest_even` and `smallest_index`. After iterating over all elements, it checks if `smallest_index` is still 0 (which would mean no even numbers were found) and returns the appropriate result.
