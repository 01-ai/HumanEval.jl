To implement the decoding function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `decode_shift` that takes a single argument `s` which is a `String`.
2. Inside the function, iterate over each character `x` in the string `s`.
3. For each character, convert it to its corresponding integer ASCII value.
4. Since the encoding function shifts each character by 5, we will shift it back by subtracting 5.
5. To handle the wrap-around of the alphabet (e.g., shifting 'a' back by 5 should give 'v'), we will add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) before applying the modulo operation.
6. Apply the modulo operation with 26 to ensure the result is within the range of lowercase letters.
7. Convert the resulting integer back to a character by adding it to the ASCII value of 'a'.
8. Join all the characters together to form the decoded string.
9. Return the decoded string.

Now, let's write the code for the `decode_shift` function:

```julia
function decode_shift(s::String)::String
    # Step 2-8: Decode each character and join them into a string
    join(((x - 'a' - 5 + 26) % 26 + 'a' for x in s))
end
```

This function assumes that the input string `s` contains only lowercase letters. If the input may contain uppercase letters or other characters, additional checks would be needed to handle those cases appropriately.
