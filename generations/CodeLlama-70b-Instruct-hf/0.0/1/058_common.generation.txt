```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    # Create a set of unique elements from l1
    s1 = Set(l1)

    # Create a set of unique elements from l2
    s2 = Set(l2)

    # Find the intersection of s1 and s2
    common_elements = intersect(s1, s2)

    # Sort and return the common elements as a vector
    return sort(collect(common_elements))
end
```

This function takes two vectors `l1` and `l2` as input and returns a sorted vector of unique common elements between them. It first creates two sets `s1` and `s2` from the input vectors, which contain only unique elements. Then, it uses the `intersect` function to find the common elements between the two sets. Finally, it sorts and collects the common elements into a vector and returns it.
