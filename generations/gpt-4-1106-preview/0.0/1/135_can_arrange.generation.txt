Certainly! Below is the Julia function `can_arrange` that implements the described functionality:

```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Iterate through the array from the second element to the end
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        # Check if the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous one
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            # Return the index of the current element
            return i
        end
    end
    # If no such element is found, return -1
    return -1
end

# Examples
println(can_arrange([1, 2, 4, 3, 5])) # Should print 4
println(can_arrange([1, 2, 3]))       # Should print -1
```

You can copy this code into your Julia environment and run it to test the function. The function iterates through the given vector and checks for the condition where an element is not greater than or equal to the one before it. If such an element is found, it returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1.
