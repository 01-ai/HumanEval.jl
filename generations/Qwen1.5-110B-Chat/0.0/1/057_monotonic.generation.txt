```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    increasing = decreasing = true
    
    for i in 2:length(l)
        if l[i] > l[i-1]
            decreasing = false
        elseif l[i] < l[i-1]
            increasing = false
        end
    end
    
    increasing || decreasing
end
```

This Julia function `monotonic` checks if the elements of the input vector `l` are either monotonically increasing or decreasing. It iterates through the vector, comparing each element to its predecessor. If any element is greater than its predecessor, it sets the `decreasing` flag to `false`. If any element is less, it sets the `increasing` flag to `false`. The function then returns `true` if at least one of these flags remains `true` (meaning the sequence is either increasing or decreasing throughout), and `false` otherwise.
