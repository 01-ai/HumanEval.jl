 Here's the implementation of the `sum_squares_round` function in Julia:

```julia
function sum_squares_round(xs::Vector)::Int
    # Round each element to the upper integer (ceiling)
    rounded_xs = ceil.(Int, xs)
    
    # Square each element and sum them up
    return sum(x^2 for x in rounded_xs)
end
```

This function first rounds each element in the input vector `xs` to the nearest integer greater than or equal to the element using `ceil.(Int, xs)`. Then, it squares each of these rounded values and sums them up using a generator expression within the `sum` function. The result is returned as an integer.
