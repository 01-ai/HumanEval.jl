Here is the implementation of the `sum_product` function in Julia, based on the provided doc string:

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    # Initialize sum to 0 and product to 1
    s = 0
    p = 1

    # Loop through the numbers
    for number in numbers
        # Add number to sum
        s += number
        # Multiply product by number
        p *= number
    end

    # Return the tuple of sum and product
    return (s, p)
end
```

This function takes a vector of integers and returns a tuple containing the sum and product of the integers in the vector. If the vector is empty, it returns `(0, 1)` as specified.
