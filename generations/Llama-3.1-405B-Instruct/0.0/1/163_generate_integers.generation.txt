Here is the Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:
```julia
function generate_integers(a::Int, b::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Ensure a is less than or equal to b
    a, b = minmax(a, b)
    
    # Generate even digits between a and b
    even_digits = [i for i in a:b if i % 2 == 0]
    
    return even_digits
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We use the `minmax` function to ensure that `a` is less than or equal to `b`, regardless of the order in which they are passed to the function.
2. We use a list comprehension to generate the even digits between `a` and `b`. We iterate over the range `a:b` and include only the numbers that are even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`).
3. Finally, we return the vector of even digits.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring to verify that it produces the correct output.
