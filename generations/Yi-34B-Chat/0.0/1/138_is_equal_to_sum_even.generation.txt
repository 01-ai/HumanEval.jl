```julia
function is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int)::Bool
    # Your code goes here
    return false
end
```

This is a placeholder function that you need to implement. To determine whether a number `n` can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, you can check if `n` is divisible by 4 and then check if it can be expressed as the sum of two pairs of consecutive even numbers. For example, for `n = 8`, we can express it as the sum of the pairs (2, 4) and (6, 8), where 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20, which is the desired sum.

Here's a possible implementation:

```julia
function is_equal_to_sum_even(n::Int)::Bool
    if n % 4 != 0
        return false
    end

    # Find the two pairs of consecutive even numbers whose sum is n
    # You can use a loop or a more efficient method like a binary search
    # to find these pairs

    # Check if the sum of these pairs is equal to n

    return true
end
```

Please note that the implementation above is a starting point and may not be the most efficient or elegant solution. You can refine the function to improve its performance or readability.
