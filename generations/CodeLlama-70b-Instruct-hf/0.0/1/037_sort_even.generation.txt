```julia
function sort_even(l::Vector)
    # Create a copy of the input list
    l_copy = copy(l)

    # Extract the even indices from the list
    even_indices = l_copy[2:2:end]

    # Sort the even indices
    sorted_even_indices = sort(even_indices)

    # Replace the even indices in the list with the sorted even indices
    l_copy[2:2:end] = sorted_even_indices

    # Return the modified list
    return l_copy
end
```

This function takes a list `l` as input, creates a copy of it, extracts the even indices from the list, sorts them, and then replaces the even indices in the original list with the sorted even indices. Finally, it returns the modified list.
