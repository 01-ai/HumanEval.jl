Here is the Julia function that implements the `top_k` functionality based on the provided docstring:
```julia
function top_k(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Check if k is within the valid range
    @assert 0 <= k <= length(xs) "k is out of range"

    # Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_xs = sort(xs, rev=true)

    # Return the top k elements
    return sorted_xs[1:k]
end
```
Here's an explanation of the implementation:

1. We first check if `k` is within the valid range using an `@assert` statement. If `k` is not within the range, an `AssertionError` will be thrown.
2. We sort the input array `xs` in descending order using the `sort` function with the `rev=true` keyword argument.
3. We return the top `k` elements of the sorted array by indexing into the sorted array with `1:k`.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the docstring:
```julia
julia> top_k([-3, -4, 5], 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  5
 -3
 -4

julia> top_k([4, -4, 4], 2)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 4

julia> top_k([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1)
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
```
Note that this implementation has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step, where n is the length of the input array. However, since the length of the array is bounded by 1000, this should not be a performance concern in practice.
