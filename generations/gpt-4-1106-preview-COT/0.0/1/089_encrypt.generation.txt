To implement the `encrypt` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `encrypt` that takes a single argument `s`, which is a string.
2. Create a variable to store the encrypted string.
3. Iterate over each character in the input string.
4. For each character, check if it is a letter.
5. If it is a letter, calculate its position in the alphabet.
6. Rotate the alphabet by shifting the letter down by 2 multiplied by 2 (i.e., 4) places.
7. Handle the wrap-around case for 'y' and 'z' by using modulo arithmetic.
8. Append the encrypted character to the encrypted string.
9. Return the encrypted string.

Now, let's write the code for the `encrypt` function:

```julia
function encrypt(s::String)
    encrypted = ""
    for c in s
        if isletter(c)
            # Calculate the new character by shifting down by 4 places
            offset = isuppercase(c) ? 'A' : 'a'
            new_char = Char(mod(Int(c) - Int(offset) + 4, 26) + Int(offset))
            encrypted *= new_char
        else
            # If it's not a letter, just append it as is
            encrypted *= c
        end
    end
    return encrypted
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(encrypt("hi"))  # Should print "lm"
println(encrypt("asdfghjkl"))  # Should print "ewhjklnop"
println(encrypt("gf"))  # Should print "kj"
println(encrypt("et"))  # Should print "ix"
```

This function assumes that the input string contains only alphabetic characters and does not handle non-alphabetic characters or uppercase letters. If the input may contain non-alphabetic characters or uppercase letters, additional checks and conversions would be necessary.
