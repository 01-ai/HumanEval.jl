Here is a step-by-step outline of how you can implement this function:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to `true`. This variable will keep track of whether all numbers in the list are below the threshold.

2. Iterate over each number `n` in the list `l`.

3. If `n` is greater than or equal to `t`, set `result` to `false` and break the loop.

4. After the loop, return `result`.

Here is the Julia code that implements this outline:

```julia
function below_threshold(l::Vector, t::Number)::Bool
    result = true
    for n in l
        if n >= t
            result = false
            break
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function works by iterating over each number in the list and checking if it is greater than or equal to the threshold. If it is, it sets `result` to `false` and breaks the loop. If no such number is found, `result` remains `true`.
