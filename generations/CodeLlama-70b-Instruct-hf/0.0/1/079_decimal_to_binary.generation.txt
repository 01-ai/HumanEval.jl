```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    # Convert the decimal number to binary format
    binary = string(bin(decimal))

    # Remove the "0b" prefix
    binary = binary[3:end]

    # Add the extra characters at the beginning and end
    binary = "db" * binary * "db"

    return binary
end
```

This function takes an integer as input and converts it to a binary string representation. It first converts the decimal number to binary using the `bin()` function, which returns a string with a "0b" prefix. The prefix is removed using array indexing, and then the extra characters are added to the beginning and end of the string. The function returns the final binary string.
