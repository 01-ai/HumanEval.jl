Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function words_string(s::String)::Vector{String}
    words = split(s, r"[, ]")
    return filter(x -> x != "", words)
end
```

This function uses the `split` function to split the input string `s` into words. The regular expression `r"[, ]"` is used to split the string at commas or spaces. The `filter` function is then used to remove any empty strings from the resulting array.
