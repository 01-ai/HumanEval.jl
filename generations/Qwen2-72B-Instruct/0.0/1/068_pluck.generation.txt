```julia
function pluck(xs::Vector{Int})
    # Initialize variables to store the smallest even value and its index
    smallest_even = typemax(Int)
    index = -1

    # Iterate over the array to find the smallest even value and its index
    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        if x % 2 == 0 && x < smallest_even
            smallest_even = x
            index = i
        end
    end

    # If an even value was found, return it and its index, otherwise return an empty array
    if index != -1
        return [smallest_even, index]
    else
        return Int[]
    end
end
```
This function will correctly implement the `pluck` function as described in the docstring. It iterates over the given array, finds the smallest even value and its index, and returns them in a list. If there are no even values or the array is empty, it returns an empty array.
