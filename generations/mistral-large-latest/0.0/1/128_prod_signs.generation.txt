Sure, here is the Julia function based on your description:

```julia
function prod_signs(xs::Vector{Int})::Union{Nothing,Int}
    if isempty(xs)
        return nothing
    end

    sign_product = 1
    mag_sum = 0

    for x in xs
        mag_sum += abs(x)
        sign_product *= sign(x)
    end

    return sign_product * mag_sum
end
```

This function first checks if the input array `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `nothing`. If `xs` is not empty, the function calculates the sum of the magnitudes of all integers in `xs` and the product of their signs. The product of the signs is calculated using the `sign` function, which returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on the sign of the number. The function then returns the product of the sum of magnitudes and the product of signs.
