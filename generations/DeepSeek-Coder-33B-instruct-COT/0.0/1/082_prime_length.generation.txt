Here is a step-by-step outline of how you can solve this problem:

1. First, you need to calculate the length of the string `s`.
2. Then, you need to check if the length is a prime number.
3. If the length is a prime number, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

Here is the Julia code that implements the above steps:

```julia
function prime_length(s::String)::Bool
    len = length(s)
    if len < 2
        return false
    end
    for i in 2:sqrt(len)
        if len % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

In this code, we first calculate the length of the string `s`. If the length is less than 2, we return `false` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. Then, we check if the length is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the length. If it is, we return `false` because the length is not a prime number. If none of these conditions are met, we return `true` because the length is a prime number.
