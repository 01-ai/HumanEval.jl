To implement the `special_factorial` function in Julia, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `special_factorial` that takes an integer `n` as an argument.
2. Check if `n` is greater than 0. If not, return an error or a special case value since the factorial is not defined for non-positive integers.
3. Initialize a variable to store the result as a `BigInt` to handle potential integer overflow for large values of `n`.
4. Loop from `n` down to 1, and for each `i` in this range:
   a. Calculate the factorial of `i` using a helper function or an inner loop.
   b. Multiply the result by the factorial of `i`.
5. Return the final result.

Now, let's write the code for the `special_factorial` function:

```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    # Step 2: Check if n is greater than 0
    if n <= 0
        throw(ArgumentError("n must be a positive integer"))
    end

    # Step 3: Initialize the result as BigInt
    result = BigInt(1)

    # Step 4: Loop from n down to 1
    for i in n:-1:1
        # Step 4a: Calculate the factorial of i
        factorial_i = BigInt(1)
        for j in 1:i
            factorial_i *= j
        end

        # Step 4b: Multiply the result by the factorial of i
        result *= factorial_i
    end

    # Step 5: Return the final result
    return result
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided example:

```julia
julia> special_factorial(4)
288
```

This code should correctly calculate the special factorial as defined.
