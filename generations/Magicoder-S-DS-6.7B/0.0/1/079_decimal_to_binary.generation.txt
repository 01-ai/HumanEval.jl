Here is a Julia function that implements the above problem:

```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    binary = string(bits(decimal))
    return "db" * binary * "db"
end
```

This function uses the `bits` function to convert the decimal number to a bit string. The `string` function is then used to convert the bit string to a string. The "db" is then added at the beginning and end of the string.

You can test the function with the following code:

```julia
println(decimal_to_binary(15))  # Output: "db1111db"
```
