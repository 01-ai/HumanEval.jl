Certainly! Below is the Julia function `string_sequence` that takes an integer `n` and returns a string containing space-delimited numbers from 0 up to `n` inclusive.

```julia
function string_sequence(n::Int)::String
    # Create a range from 0 to n and join the elements with spaces
    return join(0:n, " ")
end

# Examples
println(string_sequence(0))  # Output: "0"
println(string_sequence(5))  # Output: "0 1 2 3 4 5"
```

You can copy this function into your Julia environment and call it with different values of `n` to test its functionality.
