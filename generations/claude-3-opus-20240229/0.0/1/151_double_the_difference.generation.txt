Here's a possible implementation of the `double_the_difference` function in Julia:

```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector{<:Real})
    sum_of_squares = 0
    for x in xs
        if isinteger(x) && x > 0 && isodd(x)
            sum_of_squares += x^2
        end
    end
    return sum_of_squares
end
```

Here's how it works:

1. The function takes a vector `xs` of type `Vector{<:Real}`, which means it accepts any vector whose elements are subtypes of the `Real` type (e.g., `Int`, `Float64`, etc.).
2. We initialize a variable `sum_of_squares` to `0`.
3. We loop over each element `x` in the input vector `xs`.
4. For each element `x`, we check if it satisfies three conditions:
   - `isinteger(x)`: `x` is an integer.
   - `x > 0`: `x` is positive.
   - `isodd(x)`: `x` is odd.
5. If all three conditions are met, we add the square of `x` (`x^2`) to `sum_of_squares`.
6. After looping over all elements, the function returns the final value of `sum_of_squares`.

Here are some test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation:

```jldoctest
julia> double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0])
10

julia> double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0])
0

julia> double_the_difference([9, -2])
81

julia> double_the_difference([0])
0
```

The function handles the edge case of an empty input vector correctly by returning `0`.
