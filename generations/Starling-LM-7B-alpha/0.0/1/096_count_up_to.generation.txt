 Here's a Julia function that implements the `count_up_to` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function count_up_to(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    primes = Vector{Int}()
    for i in 2:n
        is_prime = true
        for j in 2:(i-1)
            if i % j == 0
                is_prime = false
                break
            end
        end
        if is_prime
            push!(primes, i)
        end
    end
    return primes
end
```

This function initializes an empty vector `primes` to store the prime numbers. It then iterates through the numbers from 2 to `n` and checks if each number is prime by dividing it by all numbers from 2 to `i-1`. If the number is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime and the loop breaks. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is considered prime and is added to the `primes` vector. Finally, the function returns the `primes` vector containing all the prime numbers less than or equal to `n`.

Here are some examples of using the `count_up_to` function:

```julia
julia> count_up_to(5)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3

julia> count_up_to(11)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 5
 7

julia> count_up_to(0)
Int64[]

julia> count_up_to(20)
8-element Vector{Int64}:
  2
  3
  5
  7
 11
 13
 17
 19

julia> count_up_to(1)
Int64[]

julia> count_up_to(18)
7-element Vector{Int64}:
  2
  3
  5
  7
 11
 13
 17
```

As you can see, the function correctly returns the prime numbers less than or equal to the input `n`.
