 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `sort_third` function in Julia based on the provided docstring:

```julia
"""
    sort_third(l::Vector)

This function takes a list `l` and returns a list l' such that l' is identical to
`l` in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the
indicies that are divisible by three are equal to the values of the
corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
7-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 6
 3
 4
 8
 9
 2
```
"""
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Extract elements at indices divisible by 3
    divisible_by_three = [l[i] for i in 1:3:length(l)]

    # Sort these elements
    sorted_divisible_by_three = sort(divisible_by_three)

    # Create a copy of the original list
    l_prime = copy(l)

    # Replace elements at indices divisible by 3 with the sorted elements
    for (i, val) in enumerate(sorted_divisible_by_three)
        l_prime[3 * (i - 1) + 3] = val
    end

    return l_prime
end
```

This function works by first extracting the elements at indices divisible by 3, sorting them, and then replacing the original elements at those indices with the sorted ones. The rest of the elements remain unchanged.
