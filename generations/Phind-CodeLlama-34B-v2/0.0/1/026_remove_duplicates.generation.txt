Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_duplicates` function in Julia:

```julia
function remove_duplicates(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    unique_numbers = Int[]
    for number in numbers
        if count(x -> x == number, numbers) == 1
            push!(unique_numbers, number)
        end
    end
    return unique_numbers
end
```

This function works by iterating over each number in the input vector. For each number, it counts how many times it occurs in the input vector using the `count` function. If it occurs only once, it is added to the `unique_numbers` vector using the `push!` function. Finally, the `unique_numbers` vector is returned.
