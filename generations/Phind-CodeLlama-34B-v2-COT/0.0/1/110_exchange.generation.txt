To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if all elements in lst1 are even. If yes, return "YES".
2. If not, count the number of odd elements in lst1 and even elements in lst2.
3. If the count of odd elements in lst1 is less than or equal to the count of even elements in lst2, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

Here is the Julia code for the function:

```julia
function exchange(lst1::Vector{Int}, lst2::Vector{Int})::String
    # Check if all elements in lst1 are even
    all_even_lst1 = all(iseven, lst1)
    if all_even_lst1
        return "YES"
    end

    # Count the number of odd elements in lst1 and even elements in lst2
    odd_count_lst1 = count(isodd, lst1)
    even_count_lst2 = count(iseven, lst2)

    # Check if it is possible to exchange elements between lst1 and lst2
    if odd_count_lst1 <= even_count_lst2
        return "YES"
    else
        return "NO"
    end
end
```

This function first checks if all elements in lst1 are even. If they are, it returns "YES". If not, it counts the number of odd elements in lst1 and even elements in lst2. If the count of odd elements in lst1 is less than or equal to the count of even elements in lst2, it returns "YES". Otherwise, it returns "NO".
