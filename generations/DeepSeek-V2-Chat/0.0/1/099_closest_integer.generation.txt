Here's the implementation of the `closest_integer` function in Julia:

```julia
function closest_integer(value::String)::Int
    num = parse(Float64, value)
    if num >= 0
        return floor(Int, num + 0.5)
    else
        return ceil(Int, num - 0.5)
    end
end
```

This function first parses the input string to a `Float64` to handle decimal numbers. It then checks if the number is non-negative or negative. For non-negative numbers, it uses `floor` with an adjustment of `0.5` to round away from zero. For negative numbers, it uses `ceil` with an adjustment of `-0.5` to achieve the same effect. This ensures that equidistant numbers are rounded away from zero as specified.
