function sort_numbers(numbers::String)::String
    # Define a dictionary to map numberals to their corresponding values
    num_dict = Dict("zero" => 0, "one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3, "four" => 4, "five" => 5, "six" => 6, "seven" => 7, "eight" => 8, "nine" => 9)

    # Split the input string into an array of words
    num_arr = split(numbers)

    # Sort the array based on the values in the dictionary
    sort!(num_arr, by=x->num_dict[x])

    # Join the sorted array into a space-delimited string
    return join(num_arr, " ")
end
```

This function takes a string of space-delimited numberals from "zero" to "nine" as input and returns a string with the numbers sorted from smallest to largest. It uses a dictionary to map numberals to their corresponding values, splits the input string into an array of words, sorts the array based on the values in the dictionary, and then joins the sorted array into a space-delimited string.
