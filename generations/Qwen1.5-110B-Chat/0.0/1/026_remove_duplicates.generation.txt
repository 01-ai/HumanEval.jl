```julia
function remove_duplicates(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    unique_numbers = Int[]  # Initialize an empty array to store unique elements
    seen = Set()  # Initialize a set to keep track of seen elements

    for num in numbers
        if num âˆ‰ seen  # Check if the element is not in the seen set
            push!(unique_numbers, num)  # Add the element to the unique_numbers array
            push!(seen, num)  # Add the element to the seen set
        end
    end

    return unique_numbers
end
```

This Julia function `remove_duplicates` takes a vector of integers as input and returns a new vector with all duplicates removed, while preserving the order of the remaining elements. It uses a set to keep track of elements that have already been encountered, ensuring that each element appears only once in the output.
