# Outline

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This will hold the sum of all odd elements at odd positions.
2. Iterate over the input vector `xs` with a for loop.
3. In each iteration, check if the current index is odd and the element at that index is odd.
4. If both conditions are met, add the element to `sum`.
5. After the loop, return `sum`.

# Code

```julia
function sum_odd_at_odd(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    sum = 0
    for i in 1:2:length(xs)  # step by 2 to consider only odd indices
        if xs[i] % 2 != 0  # check if the element is odd
            sum += xs[i]
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function works by iterating over the elements of `xs` with a step of 2, which means it only considers odd indices. Then, for each element, it checks if it's odd and, if it is, adds it to `sum`. Finally, it returns `sum`.
