Here is a Julia function that implements the `is_bored` function based on the provided doc string:
```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the input string into sentences
    sentences = split(s, ['.', '?', '!'])

    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0

    # Iterate over each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the sentence
        sentence = strip(sentence)

        # Check if the sentence starts with "I" (case-sensitive)
        if startswith(sentence, "I")
            # If it does, increment the boredom count
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end

    # Return the total boredom count
    return boredom_count
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We first split the input string into individual sentences using the `split` function with a character array containing the sentence delimiters (`['.', '?', '!']`).
2. We initialize a counter variable `boredom_count` to keep track of the number of boredoms.
3. We iterate over each sentence in the `sentences` array.
4. For each sentence, we strip leading and trailing whitespace using the `strip` function.
5. We check if the sentence starts with the word "I" using the `startswith` function. If it does, we increment the `boredom_count` variable.
6. Finally, we return the total `boredom_count` at the end of the function.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the doc string:
```julia
julia> is_bored("Hello world")
0

julia> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
1
```
