Here is the Julia function that solves the problem:

```julia
function hex_key(num::String)::Int
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
    count = 0
    for hex in num
        dec = parse(Int, hex, base=16)
        if dec in primes
            count += 1
        end
    end
    return count
end
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string, converting it to a decimal number using the `parse` function with base 16. Then it checks if this decimal number is in the list of prime hexadecimal digits. If it is, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.
