 Here's the Julia function `pairs_sum_to_zero` based on the provided documentation:

```julia
function pairs_sum_to_zero(l::Vector{Int})::Bool
    seen = Set{Int}()
    for elem in l
        target = -elem
        if target in seen
            return true
        else
            push!(seen, elem)
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This function uses a set called `seen` to keep track of the elements it has encountered so far. It iterates through the input list `l` and for each element `elem`, it calculates the target value as the negative of the current element (`target = -elem`). If the target value is already in the `seen` set, it means that there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, so the function returns `true`. Otherwise, it adds the current element to the `seen` set. If the loop finishes without finding a pair of elements that sum to zero, the function returns `false`.
