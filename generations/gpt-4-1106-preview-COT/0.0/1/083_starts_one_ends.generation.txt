To implement the `starts_one_ends` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if `n` is a positive integer. If not, return an error or 0.
2. If `n` is 1, then all single-digit numbers (1-9) start and end with themselves, so there are 1 such number.
3. For `n` greater than 1, we can calculate the count as follows:
   - Numbers that start with 1: There are 10^(n-1) such numbers because the first digit is fixed as 1 and the remaining (n-1) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - Numbers that end with 1: Similarly, there are 10^(n-1) such numbers because the last digit is fixed as 1 and the remaining (n-1) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - However, we have double-counted the numbers that both start and end with 1. There are 10^(n-2) such numbers (if n > 1) because the first and last digits are fixed as 1 and the remaining (n-2) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - To get the final count, we add the counts of numbers that start with 1 and numbers that end with 1, then subtract the count of numbers that both start and end with 1.
4. Return the final count.

Now, let's write the code for the function:

```julia
function starts_one_ends(n::Int)::Int
    # Step 1: Check if n is a positive integer
    if n <= 0
        throw(ArgumentError("n must be a positive integer"))
    end
    
    # Step 2: Handle the case when n is 1
    if n == 1
        return 1
    end
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the count for n > 1
    start_with_1 = 10^(n-1)
    end_with_1 = 10^(n-1)
    both_start_end_with_1 = 10^(n-2)
    
    # Step 4: Return the final count
    return start_with_1 + end_with_1 - both_start_end_with_1
end
```

This function should now correctly calculate the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1
