 Here's the implementation of the `will_it_fly` function in Julia:

```julia
function will_it_fly(q::Vector{Int}, w::Int)::Bool
    # Check if the list is palindromic
    is_palindromic = q == reverse(q)
    
    # Calculate the sum of the elements
    sum_elements = sum(q)
    
    # Check if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight
    is_within_weight = sum_elements <= w
    
    # The object will fly if it's balanced and the sum is within the weight limit
    return is_palindromic && is_within_weight
end
```

This function first checks if the list `q` is palindromic by comparing it to its reverse. Then, it calculates the sum of the elements in `q`. Finally, it checks if the sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible weight `w`. The function returns `true` if both conditions are met, otherwise it returns `false`.
