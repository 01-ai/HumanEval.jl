Here is the Julia function `add_elements` that implements the functionality described in the doc string:

```julia
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum_of_elements = 0
    
    # Iterate over the first k elements of the array
    for i in 1:k
        # Check if the element has at most two digits
        if xs[i] >= -99 && xs[i] <= 99
            # Add the element to the sum
            sum_of_elements += xs[i]
        end
    end
    
    # Return the sum of elements with at most two digits
    return sum_of_elements
end

# Example usage
println(add_elements([111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 4))  # Output should be 24
```

This function iterates over the first `k` elements of the input vector `xs` and checks if each element has at most two digits by verifying that it is between -99 and 99, inclusive. If the condition is met, the element is added to the sum. Finally, the function returns the calculated sum.
