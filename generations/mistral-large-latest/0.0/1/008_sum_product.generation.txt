Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function sum_product(numbers::Vector{Int})::Tuple{Int, Int}
    sum = 0
    product = 1
    for number in numbers
        sum += number
        product *= number
    end
    return (sum, product)
end
```
This function initializes the sum to 0 and the product to 1. It then iterates over each number in the input vector, adding it to the sum and multiplying it into the product. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the sum and the product.
