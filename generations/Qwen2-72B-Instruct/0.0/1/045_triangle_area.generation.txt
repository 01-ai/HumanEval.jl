Here is the Julia function that meets the requirements specified in the docstring:

```julia
function triangle_area(a, h)
    return 0.5 * a * h
end
```

This function calculates the area of a triangle given the length of a side (`a`) and the height (`h`) perpendicular to that side. The formula used is `area = 0.5 * base * height`.
