    # Check if there is exactly one dot in the file name
    if count(c -> c == '.', file_name) != 1
        return "No"
    end

    # Split the file name into the name and extension parts
    name_part, extension_part = split(file_name, '.', limit=2)

    # Check if the name part is not empty and starts with a latin alphabet letter
    if isempty(name_part) || !occursin(r"^[a-zA-Z]", name_part)
        return "No"
    end

    # Check if the extension part is one of the allowed extensions
    if extension_part âˆ‰ ["txt", "exe", "dll"]
        return "No"
    end

    # Check if there are more than three digits in the name part
    if length(filter(c -> isdigit(c), name_part)) > 3
        return "No"
    end

    # If all checks pass, the file name is valid
    return "Yes"
end
