    end

    # Initialize the pile
    pile = Int[]

    # Add the first level with n stones
    push!(pile, n)

    # Iterate over the remaining levels
    for i in 1:n-1
        # If the current level is odd, add the next odd number
        if pile[i] % 2 == 1
            push!(pile, pile[i] + 2)
        # If the current level is even, add the next even number

This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns a vector of integers representing the pile of stones. It first checks if `n` is positive and throws an error if it is not. Then, it initializes an empty vector `pile` and adds the first level with `n` stones. Finally, it iterates over the remaining levels and adds the next odd or even number based on the current level's parity.
