### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: Implement a helper function to check if a number is prime. This function will take an integer as input and return `true` if the number is prime, otherwise `false`.

2. **Find Largest Prime**: Iterate through the list of integers to find the largest prime number. Use the helper function from step 1 to check if a number is prime.

3. **Sum of Digits**: Once the largest prime number is found, calculate the sum of its digits. This can be done by converting the number to a string, iterating through each character, converting each character back to an integer, and summing these integers.

4. **Return Result**: Return the sum of the digits of the largest prime number found in the list.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
# Step 1: Helper function to check if a number is prime
function is_prime(n::Int)::Bool
    if n <= 1
        return false
    end
    for i in 2:sqrt(n)
        if n % i == 0
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end

# Main function as described in the docstring
function skjkasdkd(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    # Step 2: Find the largest prime number in the list
    largest_prime = 0
    for x in xs
        if is_prime(x) && x > largest_prime
            largest_prime = x
        end
    end
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the sum of digits of the largest prime number
    sum_of_digits = sum([parse(Int, c) for c in string(largest_prime)])
    
    # Step 4: Return the result
    return sum_of_digits
end
```

This implementation follows the outlined steps to find the largest prime number in a list and then calculates the sum of its digits, as required by the task.
