Here is the implementation of the `special_factorial` function in Julia:

```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    result = BigInt(1)
    for i in 1:n
        result *= factorial(i)
    end
    return result
end
```

This function calculates the special factorial by multiplying the factorials of each number from 1 to `n`. The `BigInt` type is used to handle large numbers.
