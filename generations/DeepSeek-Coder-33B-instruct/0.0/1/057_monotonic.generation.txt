Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    diffs = [l[i+1] - l[i] for i in 1:(length(l)-1)]
    return all(x -> x >= 0, diffs) || all(x -> x <= 0, diffs)
end
```

This function works by creating a list of differences between consecutive elements in the input list. If all differences are non-negative (i.e., the list is monotonically increasing), or all differences are non-positive (i.e., the list is monotonically decreasing), the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
