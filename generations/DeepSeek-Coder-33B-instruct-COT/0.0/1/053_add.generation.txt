Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Define a function named `add` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`.
2. Inside the function, add `x` and `y` and return the result.

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function add(x::Int, y::Int)
    return x + y
end
```

You can test the function with the following code:

```julia
println(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
println(add(5, 7))  # Output: 12
```
