To implement the `largest_prime_factor` function in Julia, we can follow these steps:

1. Start by dividing `n` by 2 to remove all the 2s that divide `n`. This is because 2 is the only even prime number, and we want to ensure that we're only dealing with odd numbers in the later steps.
2. After removing all factors of 2, we start checking for odd factors starting from 3. We increment by 2 in each step (since all prime numbers greater than 2 are odd).
3. If we find a factor, we divide `n` by this factor as many times as possible and update the largest prime factor found so far.
4. We continue this process until `n` becomes 1 or until the current factor exceeds the square root of `n`. If `n` is not 1 by the end of the loop, it means `n` itself is a prime number and is the largest prime factor.

Here's how the function can be implemented:

```julia
function largest_prime_factor(n::Int)::Int
    # Step 1: Remove all the 2s that divide n
    largest_factor = 0
    while n % 2 == 0
        largest_factor = 2
        n = n รท 2
    end

    # Step 2: Check for odd factors
    factor = 3
    while factor * factor <= n
        while n % factor == 0
            largest_factor = factor
            n = n รท factor
        end
        factor += 2
    end

    # Step 3: If n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2
        largest_factor = n
    end

    return largest_factor
end
```

This function efficiently finds the largest prime factor of `n` by dividing `n` by its smallest factors first, ensuring that when we're done, the remaining `n` (if greater than 2) is the largest prime factor.
