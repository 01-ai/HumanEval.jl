Here is a Julia function that implements the encryption as described in the problem:

```julia
function encrypt(s::String)
    encrypted_string = ""
    for c in s
        if islowercase(c)
            encrypted_string *= Char(Int('a') + ((Int(c) - Int('a') + 2*2) % 26))
        elseif isuppercase(c)
            encrypted_string *= Char(Int('A') + ((Int(c) - Int('A') + 2*2) % 26))
        else
            encrypted_string *= c
        end
    end
    return encrypted_string
end
```

This function iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is a lowercase or uppercase letter, it calculates the encrypted character by shifting it down by two places and then multiplying it by two. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the encrypted string as is.
