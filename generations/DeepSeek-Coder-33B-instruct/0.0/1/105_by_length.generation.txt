Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function by_length(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{String}
    num_to_str = ["Zero", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"]
    filtered_xs = filter(x -> 1 <= x <= 9, xs)
    sorted_xs = sort(filtered_xs)
    reversed_xs = reverse(sorted_xs)
    return [num_to_str[x+1] for x in reversed_xs]
end
```

This function first filters the input array to only include numbers between 1 and 9. It then sorts this filtered array and reverses it. Finally, it replaces each digit by its corresponding name from "One" to "Nine" and returns the resulting array.

The function uses a list comprehension to create the final array. The `+1` is used to index into the `num_to_str` array because Julia arrays are 1-indexed, but the numbers in the input array are 0-indexed.
