Here is the Julia function that calculates the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a given list of numbers:

```julia
function mean_absolute_deviation(numbers::Vector{Float64})::Float64
    mean_val = sum(numbers) / length(numbers)
    abs_diffs = abs.(numbers .- mean_val)
    mad_val = sum(abs_diffs) / length(numbers)
    return mad_val
end
```

In this function, we first calculate the mean of the numbers. Then, we calculate the absolute differences between each number and the mean. Finally, we calculate the mean of these absolute differences, which is the Mean Absolute Deviation.
