 Here's the implementation of the `common` function in Julia:

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    # Find the intersection of the two lists
    intersection = intersect(l1, l2)
    # Return the sorted unique common elements
    return sort(intersection)
end
```

This function uses the `intersect` function to find the common elements between the two lists and then sorts them using the `sort` function. The result is a sorted vector of unique common elements.
