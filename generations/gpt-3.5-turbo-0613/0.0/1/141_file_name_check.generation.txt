Here is the implementation for the `file_name_check` function:

```julia
function file_name_check(file_name::String)::String
    # Check if there are more than three digits in the file's name
    if count(isdigit, file_name) > 3
        return "No"
    end
    
    # Check if there is exactly one dot in the file's name
    if count(isequal('.'), file_name) != 1
        return "No"
    end
    
    # Split the file's name into two parts: before and after the dot
    parts = split(file_name, '.')
    before_dot = parts[1]
    after_dot = parts[2]
    
    # Check if the substring before the dot is empty or doesn't start with a letter
    if isempty(before_dot) || !isletter(before_dot[1])
        return "No"
    end
    
    # Check if the substring after the dot is not one of ["txt", "exe", "dll"]
    if !(after_dot in ["txt", "exe", "dll"])
        return "No"
    end
    
    return "Yes"
end
```

You can test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(file_name_check("example.txt"))  # Output: "Yes"
println(file_name_check("1example.dll"))  # Output: "No"
```
