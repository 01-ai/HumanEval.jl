Here is the Julia function that implements the given problem:

```julia
function sum_squares_round(xs::Vector)::Int
    return sum(round.(Int, x)^2 for x in xs)
end
```

This function uses a comprehension to iterate over each element in the input vector `xs`, rounding it to the nearest integer using the `round` function and then squaring it using the `^` operator. The `sum` function then adds up all the squared and rounded numbers.
