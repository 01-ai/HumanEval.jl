Here's the implementation of the function `f` in Julia:

```julia
function f(n::Int)::Vector{Int}
    result = Vector{Int}(undef, n)
    for i in 1:n
        if i % 2 == 0
            result[i] = factorial(i)
        else
            result[i] = sum(1:i)
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

This function initializes a vector of size `n` and then iterates over each index `i` from 1 to `n`. For even indices, it calculates the factorial of `i` using the `factorial` function, and for odd indices, it calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to `i` using the `sum` function. The results are stored in the `result` vector, which is then returned.
