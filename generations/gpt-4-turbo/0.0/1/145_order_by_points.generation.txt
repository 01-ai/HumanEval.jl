```julia
function order_by_points(nums::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    # Helper function to calculate the sum of digits of an integer
    function digit_sum(n::Int)
        return sum(abs.(digits(n)))
    end

    # Sort the numbers based on the sum of their digits
    # If two numbers have the same digit sum, they will remain in their original order
    # because Julia's sort is stable by default
    return sort(nums, by=digit_sum)
end
```

This function `order_by_points` sorts a vector of integers based on the sum of their digits. It uses a helper function `digit_sum` to compute the sum of the absolute values of the digits of an integer. The main function sorts the vector using the `sort` function with a custom sorting key provided by the `digit_sum` function. The sort in Julia is stable, which means that elements with the same key value retain their relative order from the input.
