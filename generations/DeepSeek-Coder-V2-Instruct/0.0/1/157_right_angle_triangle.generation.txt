 Here's the implementation of the `right_angle_triangle` function in Julia:

```julia
"""
    right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool

Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return `true` if the three
sides form a right-angled triangle, `false` otherwise. A right-angled triangle
is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 90 degree.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5)
true

julia> right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3)
false
```
"""
function right_angle_triangle(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)::Bool
    # Sort the sides to ensure the largest side is considered as the hypotenuse
    sides = sort([a, b, c])
    a, b, c = sides[1], sides[2], sides[3]
    
    # Check if the square of the largest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides
    return c^2 ≈ a^2 + b^2
end
```

This function first sorts the sides of the triangle to ensure that the largest side is considered as the hypotenuse. Then, it checks if the Pythagorean theorem holds for these sides, using the `≈` operator to handle floating-point comparisons.
