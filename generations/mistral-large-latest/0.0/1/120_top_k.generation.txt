Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function top_k(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    @assert 0 <= k <= length(xs) "k must be in the range of [0, length(xs)]"
    sort!(xs, rev=true)
    return xs[1:k]
end
```

This function first sorts the input array `xs` in descending order using the `sort!` function with `rev=true`. Then it returns the first `k` elements of the sorted array. The `@assert` macro is used to ensure that `k` is within the valid range. If `k` is not within the valid range, an error will be thrown.
