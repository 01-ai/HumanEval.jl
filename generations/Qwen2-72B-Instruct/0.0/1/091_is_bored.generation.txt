```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences based on '.', '?' or '!'
    sentences = split(s, r"[.?!]")
    boredom_count = 0

    # Iterate through each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Remove leading and trailing whitespaces
        trimmed_sentence = strip(sentence)
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if startswith(trimmed_sentence, "I")
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end

    return boredom_count
end
```
This function takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of sentences that start with "I". It first splits the string into sentences based on '.', '?' or '!', then iterates through each sentence, checking if it starts with "I" (ignoring leading and trailing whitespaces). The count of such sentences is returned as the result.
