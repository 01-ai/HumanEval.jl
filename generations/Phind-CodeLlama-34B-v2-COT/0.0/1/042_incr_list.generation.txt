```julia
function incr_list(xs::Vector)::Vector
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the incremented elements
    result = Vector{Int64}()

    # Iterate over each element in the input vector
    for x in xs
        # Increment the element by 1 and push it to the result vector
        push!(result, x + 1)
    end

    # Return the result vector
    return result
end
```
