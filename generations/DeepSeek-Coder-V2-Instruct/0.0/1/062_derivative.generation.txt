 Here's the implementation of the `derivative` function in Julia:

```julia
function derivative(xs::Vector)::Vector
    n = length(xs)
    if n <= 1
        return []
    end
    result = Vector{eltype(xs)}(undef, n - 1)
    for i in 2:n
        result[i - 1] = xs[i] * (i - 1)
    end
    return result
end
```

This function calculates the derivative of a polynomial represented by its coefficients. The derivative of a term `a_n * x^n` is `n * a_n * x^(n-1)`. The function iterates through the coefficients, multiplies each by its corresponding power (index minus one), and stores the result in a new vector.
