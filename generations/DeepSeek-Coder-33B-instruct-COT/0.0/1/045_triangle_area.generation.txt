Here is a step-by-step outline of how to solve this problem:

1. Define a function named `triangle_area` that takes two arguments: `a` and `h`.
2. Inside the function, calculate the area of the triangle using the formula `(a * h) / 2`.
3. Return the calculated area.

Here is the Julia code that implements this outline:

```julia
function triangle_area(a, h)
    area = (a * h) / 2
    return area
end
```

You can test this function with the example provided in the doc string:

```julia
julia> triangle_area(5, 3)
7.5
```
