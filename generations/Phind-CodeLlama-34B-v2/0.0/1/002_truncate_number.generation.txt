Here is the Julia function based on the given doc string:

```julia
function truncate_number(number::Float64)::Float64
    return number - floor(number)
end
```

This function works by subtracting the integer part of the number (obtained by calling `floor(number)`) from the original number, thus returning only the decimal part.
