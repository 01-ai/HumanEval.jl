```julia
function prime_fib(n::Int)::Int
    # Base cases
    if n == 1
        return 2
    elseif n == 2
        return 3
    end

    # Initialize the Fibonacci sequence
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in 1:n-2
        # Calculate the next number in the Fibonacci sequence
        a, b = b, a + b
        # Check if the current number is prime
        if isprime(a)
            # If it's prime, return it
            return a
        end
    end

    # The last number in the Fibonacci sequence is the n-th number
    return a
end
```

This function calculates the n-th Fibonacci number and checks if it's prime. If it is, it returns that number. If not, it continues to the next number in the sequence until it finds a prime or reaches the end of the sequence.
