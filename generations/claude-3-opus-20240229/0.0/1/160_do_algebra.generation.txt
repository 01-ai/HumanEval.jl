Here's a Julia function that implements the `do_algebra` functionality:

```julia
function do_algebra(operators::Vector{String}, operands::Vector{Int})
    result = operands[1]
    for i in 1:length(operators)
        op = operators[i]
        if op == "+"
            result += operands[i+1]
        elseif op == "-"
            result -= operands[i+1]
        elseif op == "*"
            result *= operands[i+1]
        elseif op == "รท"
            result = fld(result, operands[i+1])  # floor division
        elseif op == "^"
            result = result ^ operands[i+1]
        end
    end
    return result
end
```

Here's how the `do_algebra` function works:

1. The function takes two arguments: `operators` (a vector of strings representing the operators) and `operands` (a vector of integers representing the operands).
2. The `result` variable is initialized with the first operand from the `operands` vector.
3. The function iterates over the `operators` vector using a `for` loop.
4. For each operator encountered, the corresponding operation is performed on the `result` using the next operand from the `operands` vector.
5. If the operator is `"+"`, the next operand is added to the `result`.
6. If the operator is `"-"`, the next operand is subtracted from the `result`.
7. If the operator is `"*"`, the `result` is multiplied by the next operand.
8. If the operator is `"รท"`, the `result` is floor-divided by the next operand using the `fld` function.
9. If the operator is `"^"`, the `result` is raised to the power of the next operand.
10. After all operations have been performed, the final `result` is returned.

Here are some examples of using the `do_algebra` function:

```jldoctest
julia> do_algebra(["+", "*", "-"], [2, 3, 4, 5])  # 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
9

julia> do_algebra(["+", "รท", "^"], [10, 2, 3, 2])  # 10 + 2 รท 3 ^ 2
10

julia> do_algebra(["*", "-"], [5, 3, 2])  # 5 * 3 - 2
13
```

Note that this implementation assumes that the input vectors are valid and meet the conditions mentioned in the problem statement (the length of the `operators` vector is one less than the length of the `operands` vector, and both vectors have at least one element).
