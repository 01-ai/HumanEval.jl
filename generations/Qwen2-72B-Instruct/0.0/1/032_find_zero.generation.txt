To find a zero of a polynomial with coefficients `xs`, we can use the Newton-Raphson method, which is an iterative method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. The method assumes the function `f` to be approximated is differentiable and uses the function's derivative `f'` to approximate the roots.

The Newton-Raphson method starts with an initial guess `x0` and iterates using the formula:

\[ x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \]

where `f(x)` is the polynomial and `f'(x)` is its derivative.

Given that we are only interested in finding one zero and that the polynomial has an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient, we can assume that there is at least one real root. We can start the iteration with an initial guess and iterate until the value of the polynomial at the current guess is close to zero or the change in the guess is very small.

Here is the implementation of the `find_zero` function using the Newton-Raphson method:

```julia
function find_zero(xs::Vector{Int})
    # Calculate the derivative of the polynomial
    function derivative(xs, x)
        return sum(i * coeff * (x^(i - 2)) for (i, coeff) in enumerate(xs) if i > 1)
    end

    # Initial guess
    x = 1.0

    # Tolerance for convergence
    tol = 1e-10

    # Maximum number of iterations
    max_iter = 1000

    for _ in 1:max_iter
        # Calculate the value of the polynomial and its derivative at x
        poly_val = poly(xs, x)
        deriv_val = derivative(xs, x)

        # Check if the derivative is zero to avoid division by zero
        if deriv_val == 0
            break
        end

        # Update the guess using the Newton-Raphson formula
        x -= poly_val / deriv_val

        # Check for convergence
        if abs(poly_val) < tol
            return x
        end
    end

    # If the method did not converge, return the last guess
    return x
end
```

This function should work for polynomials with an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient, as specified in the docstring. Note that the Newton-Raphson method may not converge for all initial guesses or for all types of functions, but it is generally effective for finding roots of smooth functions.
