 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `match_parens` function in Julia based on the given docstring:

```julia
"""
    match_parens(lst::Vector{String})::String

You are given a list of two strings, both strings consist of open parentheses
"(" or close parentheses ")" only. Your job is to check if it is possible to
concatenate the two strings in some order, that the resulting string will be
good. A string S is considered to be good if and only if all parentheses in S
are balanced. For example: the string "(())()" is good, while the string "())"
is not. Return "Yes" if there"s a way to make a good string, and return "No"
otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match_parens(["()(", ")"])
"Yes"

julia> match_parens([")", ")"])
"No"
```
"""
function match_parens(lst::Vector{String})::String
    s1, s2 = lst

    function is_balanced(s::String)::Bool
        balance = 0
        for char in s
            if char == '('
                balance += 1
            elseif char == ')'
                balance -= 1
            end
            if balance < 0
                return false
            end
        end
        return balance == 0
    end

    if is_balanced(s1 * s2) || is_balanced(s2 * s1)
        return "Yes"
    else
        return "No"
    end
end

# Examples
println(match_parens(["()(", ")"]))  # Output: "Yes"
println(match_parens([")", ")"]))    # Output: "No"
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `match_parens` takes a vector of two strings as input.
2. **Helper Function**: Inside `match_parens`, there is a helper function `is_balanced` that checks if a given string is balanced.
   - It uses a counter `balance` to keep track of the number of open parentheses.
   - It iterates through each character in the string, incrementing `balance` for '(' and decrementing for ')'.
   - If `balance` becomes negative at any point, the string is not balanced.
   - Finally, it checks if `balance` is zero, indicating that all parentheses are matched.
3. **Concatenation Check**: The function checks if either `s1 * s2` or `s2 * s1` is balanced using the `is_balanced` function.
4. **Return Result**: It returns "Yes" if any of the concatenations are balanced, otherwise "No".

This implementation ensures that the function correctly determines if the two strings can be concatenated in any order to form a balanced string.
