Here is the Julia function that meets the requirements:
```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    total_chars_xs = sum(length(x) for x in xs)
    total_chars_ys = sum(length(y) for y in ys)
    
    if total_chars_xs <= total_chars_ys
        return xs
    else
        return ys
    end
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We calculate the total number of characters in each list using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
2. We compare the total number of characters in each list. If the first list has fewer or equal characters, we return it. Otherwise, we return the second list.

You can test this function with the examples provided in the docstring to verify its correctness. Let me know if you have any further questions!
