Sure, here is the Julia function based on your description:

```julia
function can_arrange(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    for i in 2:length(xs)
        if xs[i] < xs[i-1]
            return i
        end
    end
    return -1
end
```
This function iterates over the array from the second element to the last one. If it finds an element that is less than the preceding one, it returns the index of that element. If no such element is found, it returns -1.
