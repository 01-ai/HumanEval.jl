Here is the implementation of the `order_by_points` function in Julia:

```julia
function order_by_points(nums::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    return sort(nums, by = x -> (sum(digits(abs(x))), findfirst(isequal(x), nums)))
end
```

This function uses the `sort` function to sort the given list of integers. The `by` argument is used to specify the sorting criteria. In this case, we sort the numbers based on the sum of their digits (`sum(digits(abs(x)))`) and their index in the original list (`findfirst(isequal(x), nums)`).

Note that we use `abs(x)` to ensure that negative numbers are also sorted correctly based on the sum of their digits.
