```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    # Initialize the sum of squares to 0
    sum_of_squares = 0

    # Iterate through the list
    for x in xs
        # Check if the number is odd and positive
        if x % 2 == 1 && x > 0
            # Add the square of the number to the sum of squares
            sum_of_squares += x^2
        end
    end

    # Return the sum of squares
    return sum_of_squares
end
```

This function iterates through the list, checks if each number is odd and positive, and adds the square of the number to the sum of squares if it meets the criteria. If the list is empty, the function returns 0.
