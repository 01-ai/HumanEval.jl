Here's the implementation of the `is_bored` function in Julia:

```julia
function is_bored(s::String)::Int
    # Split the string into sentences based on '.', '?', or '!'
    sentences = split(s, r"[.!?]")
    
    # Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each sentence
    for sentence in sentences
        # Trim leading and trailing whitespace
        sentence = strip(sentence)
        
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if startswith(sentence, "I")
            boredom_count += 1
        end
    end
    
    return boredom_count
end
```

This function works by splitting the input string into individual sentences using the delimiters '.', '?', and '!'. It then iterates over each sentence, trims any leading or trailing whitespace, and checks if the sentence starts with the word "I". If it does, the boredom counter is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of boredoms found in the input string.
