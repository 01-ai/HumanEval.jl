 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `sum_to_n` function in Julia based on the provided docstring:

```julia
"""
    sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int

`sum_to_n` is a function that sums numbers from `1` to `n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum_to_n(30)
465

julia> sum_to_n(100)
5050

julia> sum_to_n(5)
15

julia> sum_to_n(10)
55

julia> sum_to_n(1)
1
```
"""
function sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int
    return n * (n + 1) รท 2
end
```

This function uses the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) รท 2`. This approach is efficient and avoids the need for a loop, making it both concise and performant.
