Here is the Julia function that implements the decimal to binary conversion as described in the docstring:
```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    binary_str = string(decimal, base = 2)
    return "db" * binary_str * "db"
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* The `string` function is used to convert the decimal number to a binary string, with the `base = 2` argument specifying that we want a binary representation.
* The resulting binary string is then concatenated with the extra characters "db" at the beginning and end using the `*` operator.

You can test this function with the example provided in the docstring:
```julia
julia> decimal_to_binary(15)
"db1111db"
```
I hope this meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further requests.
