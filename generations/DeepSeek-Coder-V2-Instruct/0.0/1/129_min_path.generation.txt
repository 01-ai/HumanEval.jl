 To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we need to perform a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each cell in the grid. The BFS will help us explore all possible paths of length `k` from each starting cell, and we will keep track of the lexicographically smallest path encountered.

Here's the implementation of the `min_path` function in Julia:

```julia
function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = length(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    function bfs(start_row, start_col)
        queue = [(start_row, start_col, [grid[start_row][start_col]])]
        visited = Set{Tuple{Int, Int}}()
        push!(visited, (start_row, start_col))
        
        while !isempty(queue)
            row, col, path = popfirst!(queue)
            
            if length(path) == k
                return path
            end
            
            for (dr, dc) in directions
                new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
                if 1 <= new_row <= N && 1 <= new_col <= N && (new_row, new_col) âˆ‰ visited
                    new_path = copy(path)
                    push!(new_path, grid[new_row][new_col])
                    push!(queue, (new_row, new_col, new_path))
                    push!(visited, (new_row, new_col))
                end
            end
        end
        
        return nothing
    end
    
    min_path = nothing
    
    for i in 1:N
        for j in 1:N
            current_path = bfs(i, j)
            if current_path !== nothing
                if min_path === nothing || current_path < min_path
                    min_path = current_path
                end
            end
        end
    end
    
    return min_path
end
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `N` is the size of the grid.
   - `directions` contains the possible moves (right, down, left, up).

2. **BFS Function**:
   - The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search starting from a given cell `(start_row, start_col)`.
   - It uses a queue to explore all possible paths of length `k`.
   - For each cell, it explores all valid neighboring cells and extends the current path.
   - If a path of length `k` is found, it returns the path.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates over all cells in the grid.
   - For each cell, it calls the `bfs` function to find the minimum path starting from that cell.
   - It keeps track of the lexicographically smallest path encountered.

4. **Return**:
   - The function returns the lexicographically smallest path of length `k`.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible paths of length `k` and find the lexicographically smallest one.
