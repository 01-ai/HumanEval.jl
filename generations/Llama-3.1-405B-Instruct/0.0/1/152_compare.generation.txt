Here is the Julia function that implements the `compare` function based on the provided doc string:
```julia
function compare(game::Vector{Int}, guess::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    return abs.(game .- guess)
end
```
Explanation:

* The function takes two input vectors `game` and `guess` of type `Vector{Int}`.
* The `.=` operator is used to perform element-wise subtraction between the two vectors.
* The `abs.` function is used to take the absolute value of each element in the resulting vector.
* The resulting vector is returned by the function.

You can test this function using the examples provided in the doc string:
```julia
julia> compare([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, -2])
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 0
 0
 0
 3
 3

julia> compare([0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 1, 1, 0, 0, -2])
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 4
 1
 0
 0
 6
```
I hope this implementation meets your requirements! Let me know if you have any further questions.
