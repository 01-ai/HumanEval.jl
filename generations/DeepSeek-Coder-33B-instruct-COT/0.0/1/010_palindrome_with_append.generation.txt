Here is a Julia function that implements the algorithm described in the doc string:

```julia
function palindrome_with_append(s::String)::String
    n = length(s)
    rev_s = reverse(s)
    for i in 0:n-1
        if s[1:n-i] == rev_s[i+1:end]
            return s * rev_s[1:i]
        end
    end
    return s * rev_s
end
```

This function works by iterating over the string `s` in reverse order, checking if the current substring from the start of `s` to the end minus the current index `i` is equal to the reverse of the substring from the current index plus one to the end of `s`. If it finds such a substring, it returns the concatenation of `s` and the reverse of the substring from the start of `s` to the current index `i`. If it doesn't find such a substring, it returns the concatenation of `s` and the reverse of `s`.

Here is how it works with the examples from the doc string:

```julia
julia> palindrome_with_append("")
""

julia> palindrome_with_append("cat")
"catac"

julia> palindrome_with_append("cata")
"catac"
```
