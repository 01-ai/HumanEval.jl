"""
    fizz_buzz(n::Int)

Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than `n` which are
divisible by 11 or 13.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fizz_buzz(50)
0

julia> fizz_buzz(78)
2

julia> fizz_buzz(79)
3
```

# Step-by-step outline:
# 1. Initialize a counter variable to store the count of 7s in the required numbers.
# 2. Iterate over the integers less than `n`.
# 3. For each integer, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13.
# 4. If it is, convert the integer to a string and count the number of 7s in it.
# 5. Add the count to the counter variable.
# 6. After the loop finishes, return the counter variable.

# Julia code:

function fizz_buzz(n::Int)
    # Initialize counter
    count = 0

    # Iterate over the integers less than `n`
    for i in 1:n-1
        # Check if the integer is divisible by 11 or 13
        if i % 11 == 0 || i % 13 == 0
            # Convert the integer to a string and count the number of 7s in it
            count += count("7", string(i))
        end
    end

    # Return the count
    return count
end
