Here is the Julia function that implements the above docstring:

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    # Find common elements between the two lists
    common_elements = intersect(l1, l2)

    # Sort the common elements
    sort!(common_elements)

    return common_elements
end
```

This function uses the `intersect` function to find the common elements between the two input vectors, and the `sort!` function to sort the resulting vector in-place.
