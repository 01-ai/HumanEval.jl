Certainly! Below is the Julia function `correct_angle_bracketing` that checks if every opening angle bracket has a corresponding closing bracket:

```julia
function correct_angle_bracketing(brackets::String)::Bool
    # Initialize a counter for the brackets
    bracket_counter = 0

    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for bracket in brackets
        # If it's an opening bracket, increment the counter
        if bracket == '<'
            bracket_counter += 1
        # If it's a closing bracket, decrement the counter
        elseif bracket == '>'
            bracket_counter -= 1
        end

        # If at any point the counter goes negative, return false
        if bracket_counter < 0
            return false
        end
    end

    # If the counter is zero, all brackets are correctly matched
    return bracket_counter == 0
end
```

You can test this function with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.
