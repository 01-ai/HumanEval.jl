Here's the implementation of the `common` function in Julia:

```julia
function common(l1::Vector, l2::Vector)::Vector
    # Convert both lists to sets to find the intersection
    set1 = Set(l1)
    set2 = Set(l2)
    
    # Find the common elements
    common_elements = intersect(set1, set2)
    
    # Convert the set back to a sorted vector
    return sort(collect(common_elements))
end
```

This function first converts the input vectors to sets to easily find the intersection of the two sets. The intersection is then converted back to a vector and sorted before being returned. This ensures that the result contains unique common elements in sorted order.
