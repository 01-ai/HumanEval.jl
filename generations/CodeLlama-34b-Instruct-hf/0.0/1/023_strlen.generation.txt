  Here is a possible implementation of the `strlen` function in Julia:
```
function strlen(x::String)::Int
    return length(x)
end
```
This function takes a string `x` as input and returns its length as an integer. The `length` function is a built-in function in Julia that returns the number of elements in a collection, such as a string.

Here are some examples of how the `strlen` function can be used:
```
julia> strlen("")
0

julia> strlen("abc")
3

julia> strlen("hello world")
11
```
Note that the `strlen` function is not a built-in function in Julia, but it can be defined using the `length` function.
