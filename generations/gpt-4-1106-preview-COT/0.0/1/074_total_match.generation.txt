### Outline

To implement the `total_match` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Define the function `total_match` that takes two arguments, `xs` and `ys`, both of which are vectors of strings.
2. Calculate the total number of characters in each list by summing the lengths of all strings in each list.
3. Compare the total number of characters in both lists.
4. If the total number of characters in `xs` is less than or equal to the total number of characters in `ys`, return `xs`.
5. Otherwise, return `ys`.

### Code

Now, let's write the code for the `total_match` function following the outline:

```julia
function total_match(xs::Vector{String}, ys::Vector{String})::Vector{String}
    # Calculate the total number of characters in each list
    total_chars_xs = sum(length, xs)
    total_chars_ys = sum(length, ys)
    
    # Compare and return the list with fewer total characters
    # If they are equal, return the first list
    if total_chars_xs <= total_chars_ys
        return xs
    else
        return ys
    end
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works as expected.

```julia
println(total_match(String[], String[])) # Should return String[]
println(total_match(["hi", "admin"], ["hI", "Hi"])) # Should return ["hI", "Hi"]
println(total_match(["hi", "admin"], ["hi", "hi", "admin", "project"])) # Should return ["hi", "admin"]
println(total_match(["hi", "admin"], ["hI", "hi", "hi"])) # Should return ["hI", "hi", "hi"]
println(total_match(["4"], ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"])) # Should return ["4"]
```

This code should work correctly according to the specifications provided in the docstring.
