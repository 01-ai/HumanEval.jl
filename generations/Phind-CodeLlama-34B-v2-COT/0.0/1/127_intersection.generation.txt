To solve this problem, we will first find the intersection of the two intervals. Then we will check if the length of the intersection is a prime number. If it is, we will return "YES", otherwise, we will return "NO". If the two intervals don't intersect, we will also return "NO".

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Find the maximum of the first elements of the two intervals and the minimum of the second elements. This will be the intersection of the two intervals.

2. If the first element of the intersection is greater than the second element, return "NO" because the intervals don't intersect.

3. Calculate the length of the intersection.

4. Check if the length of the intersection is a prime number.

5. If the length of the intersection is a prime number, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

Here is the Julia code:

```julia
function intersection(interval1::Vector{Int}, interval2::Vector{Int})::String
    # Find the intersection of the two intervals
    intersection = [max(interval1[1], interval2[1]), min(interval1[2], interval2[2])]

    # If the intervals don't intersect, return "NO"
    if intersection[1] > intersection[2]
        return "NO"
    end

    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    len_intersection = intersection[2] - intersection[1] + 1

    # Check if the length of the intersection is a prime number
    if len_intersection < 2
        return "NO"
    end

    for i in 2:len_intersection รท 2
        if len_intersection % i == 0
            return "NO"
        end
    end

    return "YES"
end
```

This function works by first finding the intersection of the two intervals. If the intervals don't intersect, it immediately returns "NO". Otherwise, it calculates the length of the intersection and checks if this length is a prime number. If the length is less than 2, it is not a prime number so it returns "NO". If the length is 2, it is a prime number so it returns "YES". If the length is greater than 2, it checks if the length is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. If it is, it is not a prime number so it returns "NO". If it is not divisible by any other number, it is a prime number so it returns "YES".
