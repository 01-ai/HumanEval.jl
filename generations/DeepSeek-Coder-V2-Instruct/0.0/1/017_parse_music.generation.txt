 Here's the implementation of the `parse_music` function in Julia:

```julia
function parse_music(music_string::String)::Vector{Int}
    # Define the mapping from note symbols to beats
    note_to_beats = Dict("o" => 4, "o|" => 2, ".|" => 1)
    
    # Split the input string into individual note symbols
    notes = split(music_string)
    
    # Initialize an empty vector to store the beats
    beats = Vector{Int}()
    
    # Iterate over each note symbol and convert it to the corresponding number of beats
    for note in notes
        if haskey(note_to_beats, note)
            push!(beats, note_to_beats[note])
        else
            error("Unknown note symbol: $note")
        end
    end
    
    return beats
end
```

This function first defines a dictionary mapping each note symbol to its corresponding number of beats. It then splits the input string into individual note symbols and iterates over them, converting each symbol to its corresponding number of beats using the dictionary. The resulting beats are stored in a vector and returned.
