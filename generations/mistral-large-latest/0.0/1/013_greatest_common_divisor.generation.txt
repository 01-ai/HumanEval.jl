Sure, I can help with that. Here's a simple implementation of the greatest common divisor (GCD) function in Julia using the Euclidean algorithm:

```julia
function greatest_common_divisor(a::Int, b::Int)::Int
    while b != 0
        a, b = b, a % b
    end
    return abs(a)
end
```

This function works by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` is zero, at which point `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`. The `abs(a)` is used to ensure the result is always positive.
