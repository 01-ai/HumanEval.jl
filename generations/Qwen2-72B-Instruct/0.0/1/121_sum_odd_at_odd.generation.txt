```julia
function sum_odd_at_odd(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    sum = 0
    for (i, x) in enumerate(xs)
        if i % 2 != 0 && x % 2 != 0
            sum += x
        end
    end
    return sum
end
```

This function iterates over the elements of the vector `xs`, checking if the index `i` (1-based) is odd and if the element `x` is odd. If both conditions are met, the element is added to the sum. Finally, the sum is returned. Note that the index `i` is 1-based, which is consistent with Julia's indexing convention.
