```julia
function add_elements(xs::Vector{Int}, k::Int)::Int
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum_elements = 0
    
    # Iterate over the first k elements of xs
    for i in 1:k
        # Check if the element has at most two digits
        if xs[i] <= 99
            # Add the element to the sum
            sum_elements += xs[i]
        end
    end
    
    return sum_elements
end
```

This Julia function `add_elements` takes an array of integers `xs` and an integer `k` as input. It iterates through the first `k` elements of `xs`, checking if each element has at most two digits. If it does, the element is added to the `sum_elements`. Finally, the function returns the total sum of these elements.
