Here is the Julia implementation of the function based on the provided docstring:

```julia
function sort_third(l::Vector)
    # Create a new vector to store the values at the indices divisible by 3
    third_values = l[3:3:end]
    
    # Sort the values
    sort!(third_values)
    
    # Create a new vector to store the result
    result = similar(l)
    
    # Fill the result vector with the sorted values
    j = 1
    for i in eachindex(l)
        if i % 3 == 0
            result[i] = third_values[j]
            j += 1
        else
            result[i] = l[i]
        end
    end
    
    return result
end
```

This function first extracts the values at the indices divisible by 3, sorts them, and then creates a new vector where the values at the indices divisible by 3 are replaced by the sorted values, while the other values are kept the same.
