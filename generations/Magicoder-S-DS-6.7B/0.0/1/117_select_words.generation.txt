Here is a Julia function that implements the `select_words` function as described in the problem:

```julia
function select_words(s::String, n::Int)::Vector{<:AbstractString}
    # Define the set of consonants
    consonants = Set("bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ")

    # Split the string into words
    words = split(s)

    # Filter the words that contain exactly n consonants
    selected_words = filter(word -> count(c -> c in consonants, word) == n, words)

    return selected_words
end
```

This function works by first defining a set of consonants. It then splits the input string into words using the `split` function. It then filters the words to keep only those that contain exactly `n` consonants. The `count` function is used to count the number of consonants in each word. If the count is equal to `n`, the word is included in the result. The result is returned as a vector of strings.
