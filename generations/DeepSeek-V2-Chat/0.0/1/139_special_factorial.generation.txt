To implement the `special_factorial` function in Julia, we need to compute the product of factorials from `n` down to `1`. Here's how you can do it:

```julia
using Base: BigInt

function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    result = BigInt(1)
    for i in 1:n
        result *= factorial(BigInt(i))
    end
    return result
end
```

This function initializes a result variable as a `BigInt` to handle large numbers. It then iterates from `1` to `n`, multiplying the result by the factorial of each number in this range. The `factorial` function from Julia's standard library is used to compute the factorial of each number, and `BigInt` is used to ensure that the computations can handle very large numbers.

Here's how the function works with the example provided:

```julia
julia> special_factorial(4)
288
```

This implementation should correctly compute the special factorial for any positive integer `n`.
