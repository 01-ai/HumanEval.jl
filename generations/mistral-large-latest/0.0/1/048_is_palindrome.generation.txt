Sure, here is the Julia function that checks if a given string is a palindrome:

```julia
function is_palindrome(text::String)::Bool
    text == reverse(text)
end
```

This function works by comparing the original string with its reverse. If they are the same, then the string is a palindrome and the function returns true. If they are not the same, then the string is not a palindrome and the function returns false.
