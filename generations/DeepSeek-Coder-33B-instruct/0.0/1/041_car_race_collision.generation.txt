The problem is a mathematical problem and not a programming problem. The number of collisions is equal to the number of cars, which is `n`.

Here is the Julia function:

```julia
function car_race_collision(n::Int)::Int
    return n
end
```

This function simply returns the input `n`, which is the number of cars. Since each car is moving in the same direction, they will collide with each other.
