To implement the `double_the_difference` function as described, we need to filter the input list to include only positive odd integers, then square each of these filtered numbers, and finally sum them up. Here's how you can do it in Julia:

```julia
function double_the_difference(xs::Vector)
    # Filter the list to include only positive odd integers
    filtered_xs = filter(x -> x > 0 && x % 2 != 0, xs)
    
    # Square each number in the filtered list and sum them up
    sum_of_squares = sum(x -> x^2, filtered_xs)
    
    return sum_of_squares
end

# Example usage
println(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]))  # Expected output: 10
println(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]))   # Expected output: 0
println(double_the_difference([9, -2]))       # Expected output: 81
println(double_the_difference([0]))           # Expected output: 0
```

This function works by first filtering the input vector to keep only the positive odd integers. Then, it uses the `sum` function with a lambda function that squares each element, effectively calculating the sum of squares of the filtered numbers.
