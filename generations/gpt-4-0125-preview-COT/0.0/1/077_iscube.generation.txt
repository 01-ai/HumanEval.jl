### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Check for Special Cases**: First, handle the special case where `a` is 0, as 0 is a cube of itself, and return `true`.

2. **Handle Negative Numbers**: Since the cube root of a negative number is negative, take the absolute value of `a` for the calculation but remember that the input can be negative.

3. **Calculate the Cube Root**: Calculate the cube root of the absolute value of `a`. This can be done using the `cbrt` function from Julia's standard library.

4. **Round and Check**: Round the cube root to the nearest integer and then cube it again to check if it matches the original number (considering its absolute value). This step is necessary because the cube root of a non-cube number will not be an integer, and rounding it will not give back the original number when cubed.

5. **Return the Result**: If the cubed value of the rounded cube root matches the absolute value of `a`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function iscube(a::Int)::Bool
    # Step 1: Handle the special case of 0
    if a == 0
        return true
    end

    # Step 2: Work with the absolute value for the calculation
    abs_a = abs(a)

    # Step 3: Calculate the cube root
    cube_root = cbrt(abs_a)

    # Step 4: Round the cube root and check if cubing it gives the original number
    rounded_root = round(cube_root)
    if rounded_root^3 == abs_a
        return true
    else
        return false
    end
end
```

This function should work correctly for all integers, including negative numbers and zero, as per the examples provided in the doc string.
