Here is the Julia function that implements the `filter_by_prefix` function as described in the docstring:

```julia
function filter_by_prefix(xs::Vector{String}, prefix::String)::Vector{String}
    return [x for x in xs if startswith(x, prefix)]
end
```

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `x` in the input vector `xs`. It includes `x` in the output vector if and only if `x` starts with the specified `prefix` (checked using the `startswith` function).
