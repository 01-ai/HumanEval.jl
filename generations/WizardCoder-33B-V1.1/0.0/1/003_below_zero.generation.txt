Here is the Julia function that implements the above logic:

```julia
function below_zero(operations::Vector{Int})::Bool
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0
            return true
        end
    end
    return false
end
```

This function works by iterating over the list of operations, adding each operation to the current balance, and checking if the balance is less than zero at any point. If it is, the function immediately returns `true`. If the function finishes iterating over all operations without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `false`.
