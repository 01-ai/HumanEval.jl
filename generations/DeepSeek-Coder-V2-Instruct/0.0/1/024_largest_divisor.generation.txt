 Here's the implementation of the `largest_divisor` function in Julia:

```julia
function largest_divisor(n::Int)::Int
    for i in reverse(1:div(n, 2))
        if n % i == 0
            return i
        end
    end
    return 1  # This line is technically unreachable for valid inputs
end
```

This function iterates from `n/2` down to `1` to find the largest divisor of `n` that is smaller than `n`. The loop starts from `n/2` because the largest possible divisor of `n` (other than `n` itself) cannot be greater than `n/2`.
