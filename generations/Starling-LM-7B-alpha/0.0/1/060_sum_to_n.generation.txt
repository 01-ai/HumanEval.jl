 Here's the Julia function `sum_to_n` based on the provided documentation:

```julia
function sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int
    return sum(1:n)
end
```

This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`. The `sum` function in Julia is used to calculate the sum of a range of numbers, and in this case, it is applied to the range `1:n`.
