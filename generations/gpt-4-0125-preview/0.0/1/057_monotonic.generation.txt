To implement the `monotonic` function in Julia, we need to check if the list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing. This can be done by comparing each element with the next one to determine the direction of monotonicity and then ensuring all subsequent elements follow the same pattern. Here's how you can do it:

```julia
function monotonic(l::Vector)::Bool
    # Handle edge cases where the list has less than 2 elements
    if length(l) < 2
        return true
    end

    # Determine if the list is initially increasing or decreasing
    increasing = l[2] > l[1]
    decreasing = l[2] < l[1]

    # Check for monotonicity
    for i in 2:length(l)-1
        if increasing && l[i] > l[i+1]
            return false
        elseif decreasing && l[i] < l[i+1]
            return false
        end
    end

    return true
end
```

This function first checks if the list is too short to determine monotonicity (less than 2 elements), in which case it returns `true` as a list with 0 or 1 element is trivially monotonic. Then, it initializes two boolean variables, `increasing` and `decreasing`, based on the comparison between the first two elements. It iterates through the list starting from the second element, checking if the current direction of monotonicity is maintained. If it finds an element that breaks the monotonicity, it returns `false`. If it completes the loop without finding such an element, it returns `true`, indicating the list is monotonic.
