Here is the Julia function that implements the given doc string:

```julia
function words_string(s::String)::Vector{String}
    return filter(x -> x != "", split(s, r"[, ]"))
end
```

This function uses the `split` function to split the string into words based on commas or spaces. The `r"[, ]"` regular expression is used to match either a comma or a space. The `filter` function is used to remove any empty strings from the resulting array.
