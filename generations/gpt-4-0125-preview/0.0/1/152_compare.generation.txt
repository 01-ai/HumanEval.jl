```julia

    # Initialize an empty vector to store the differences
    differences = Vector{Int}(undef, length(game))
    
    # Iterate through each match
    for i in 1:length(game)
        # Calculate the absolute difference between the game score and the guess
        differences[i] = abs(game[i] - guess[i])
    end
