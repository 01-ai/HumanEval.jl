### Step-by-step outline:

1. Check if the input vector `xs` is empty. If it is, return `Nothing`.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the product of signs, starting with 1.
3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum of magnitudes, starting with 0.
4. Iterate over each element in the input vector `xs`.
   - For each element, determine its sign (1 for positive, -1 for negative, 0 for zero).
   - Multiply the current product of signs by the sign of the current element.
   - Add the absolute value (magnitude) of the current element to the sum of magnitudes.
5. If the product of signs is 0, return 0 (since multiplying anything by 0 results in 0).
6. Otherwise, return the sum of magnitudes multiplied by the product of signs.

### Julia code:

```julia
function prod_signs(xs::Vector{Int})::Union{Nothing,Int}
    # Step 1: Check for empty vector
    if isempty(xs)
        return nothing
    end

    # Step 2: Initialize product of signs
    sign_product = 1

    # Step 3: Initialize sum of magnitudes
    magnitude_sum = 0

    # Step 4: Iterate over elements
    for x in xs
        # Determine the sign and update the product of signs
        sign_product *= if x > 0
            1
        elseif x < 0
            -1
        else
            0
        end

        # Break early if sign_product is 0
        if sign_product == 0
            return 0
        end

        # Update the sum of magnitudes
        magnitude_sum += abs(x)
    end

    # Step 5 & 6: Return the result
    return magnitude_sum * sign_product
end
```

This function should work as expected based on the provided doc string. Let's implement the code.
