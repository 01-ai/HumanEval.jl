### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize an empty string**: This will be used to build the binary representation of the given decimal number.

2. **Convert decimal to binary**:
   - While the decimal number is greater than 0, divide the number by 2 and prepend the remainder (either 0 or 1) to the string initialized in step 1. This is because the binary representation is constructed from the remainder of successive divisions by 2.
   - If the decimal number is 0, simply return "db0db" as the binary representation of 0 is 0, with the required format.

3. **Add 'db' prefix and suffix**: Once the binary string is constructed, prepend and append 'db' to the string to match the required format.

4. **Return the formatted string**: The final string, now containing the binary representation with 'db' at the beginning and end, is returned.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
function decimal_to_binary(decimal::Int)::String
    # Step 1: Initialize an empty string for the binary representation
    binary_str = ""
    
    # Special case for 0
    if decimal == 0
        return "db0db"
    end
    
    # Step 2: Convert decimal to binary
    while decimal > 0
        remainder = decimal % 2
        decimal = decimal รท 2  # Integer division
        binary_str = string(remainder) * binary_str  # Prepend the remainder
    end
    
    # Step 3: Add 'db' prefix and suffix
    formatted_str = "db" * binary_str * "db"
    
    # Step 4: Return the formatted string
    return formatted_str
end
```

This function correctly handles the conversion of a decimal number to its binary representation, including the special formatting with 'db' at the beginning and end of the returned string.
