To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. We iterate through the string and for each character, we push it into the stack if it is '[' and if it is ']', we check if the top of the stack is '['. If it is, we pop the '[' from the stack and continue. If the stack is empty after this operation, we return false. If there is any character left in the stack after the iteration, we return true.

Here is the step-by-step outline:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate through the string.
3. If the current character is '[', push it into the stack.
4. If the current character is ']' and the top of the stack is '[', pop the '[' from the stack.
5. After the iteration, if there is any character left in the stack, return true. Otherwise, return false.

And here is the Julia code:

```julia
function is_nested(s::String)::Bool
    stack = Char[]
    for c in s
        if c == '['
            push!(stack, c)
        elseif c == ']' && !isempty(stack) && stack[end] == '['
            pop!(stack)
        end
    end
    return !isempty(stack)
end
```

This function works by keeping track of the brackets in a stack. When it encounters a '[', it adds it to the stack. When it encounters a ']', it checks if the top of the stack is a '['. If it is, it removes the '[' from the stack. After going through all the characters in the string, if there are any characters left in the stack, it means that there is a nested sequence of brackets and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
