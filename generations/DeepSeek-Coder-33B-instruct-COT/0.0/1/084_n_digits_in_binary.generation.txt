Here is a step-by-step outline of how to solve this problem:

1. Convert the integer N to binary.
2. Convert the binary number to a string.
3. Sum the digits in the string.
4. Return the sum as a string.

Here is the Julia code that implements this outline:

```julia
function n_digits_in_binary(N::Int)::String
    binary_N = string(N, base = 2)
    sum_digits = sum(parse(Int, digit) for digit in binary_N)
    return string(sum_digits)
end
```

This function works by first converting the integer N to a binary string using the `string` function with `base = 2`. Then, it sums the digits in the binary string by iterating over each character in the string and parsing it as an integer. Finally, it returns the sum as a string.
