Here is the implementation for the `by_length` function:

```julia
function by_length(xs::Vector{Int})::Vector{String}
    # Filter and sort the integers between 1 and 9
    filtered = sort(filter(x -> x in 1:9, xs))
    
    # Reverse the filtered array
    reversed_array = reverse(filtered)
    
    # Replace each digit by its corresponding name
    names = ["One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine"]
    result = [names[x] for x in reversed_array]
    
    return result
end
```
