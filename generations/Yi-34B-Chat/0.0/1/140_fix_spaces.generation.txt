```julia
function fix_spaces(s::String)::String
    # Replace all spaces with underscores
    s = replace(s, ' ' => '_')
    # Check for consecutive underscores and replace them with dashes
    while occursin(r"__+", s)
        s = replace(s, r"__+" => "-")
    end
    return s
end
```

This function first replaces all spaces with underscores. Then, it looks for sequences of two or more underscores and replaces them with dashes. The `occsin` function is used to check for the presence of the pattern, and `replace` is used to replace the pattern with a dash.
