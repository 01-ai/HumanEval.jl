Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `special_factorial` function in Julia:

```julia
function special_factorial(n::Int)::BigInt
    if n <= 0
        throw(ArgumentError("n must be a positive integer"))
    end
    
    result = BigInt(1)
    for i in 1:n
        result *= factorial(BigInt(i))
    end
    
    return result
end

# Example usage:
# println(special_factorial(4)) # This should output 288
```

This function calculates the Brazilian factorial of a given positive integer `n` by multiplying the factorials of all integers from `n` down to `1`. The `BigInt` type is used to handle potentially large numbers that can result from the factorial calculations.
