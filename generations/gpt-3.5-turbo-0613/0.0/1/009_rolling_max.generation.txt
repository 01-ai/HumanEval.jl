Here is the implementation of the `rolling_max` function in Julia:

```julia
function rolling_max(numbers::Vector{Int})::Vector{Int}
    max_numbers = Int[]
    current_max = -Inf
    for number in numbers
        current_max = max(current_max, number)
        push!(max_numbers, current_max)
    end
    return max_numbers
end
```

This function iterates over the input list of numbers and keeps track of the current maximum number seen so far. For each number, it updates the current maximum if necessary and appends it to the `max_numbers` list. Finally, it returns the `max_numbers` list, which contains the rolling maximum elements.
