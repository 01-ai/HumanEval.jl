  Here's one possible implementation of the `move_one_ball` function in Julia:
```
function move_one_ball(xs::Vector{Int})::Bool
    # Check if the array is empty
    if isempty(xs)
        return true
    end

    # Check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order
    if issorted(xs)
        return true
    end

    # Perform a right shift operation on the array
    xs = circshift(xs, 1)

    # Check if the array is now sorted in non-decreasing order
    if issorted(xs)
        return true
    end

    # If the array is not sorted after a single right shift operation,
    # it is not possible to get non-decreasing order by performing
    # any number of right shift operations.
    return false
end
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The function first checks if the input array `xs` is empty. If it is, the function returns `true` since the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. The function then checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `true`.
3. The function performs a right shift operation on the array `xs` by calling the `circshift` function with a shift of 1. This moves the last element of the array to the first position and shifts all other elements to the right.
4. The function then checks if the array is now sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `true`.
5. If the array is not sorted after a single right shift operation, the function returns `false`. This is because it is not possible to get non-decreasing order by performing any number of right shift operations.

Note that the `issorted` function is used to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The `circshift` function is used to perform the right shift operation on the array.
