Here's the Julia function `eat` based on the provided doc string:

```julia
function eat(number::Int, need::Int, remaining::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Calculate the number of carrots that can be eaten
    eaten = min(need, remaining)
    
    # Update the total number of eaten carrots
    total_eaten = number + eaten
    
    # Calculate the number of carrots left after eating
    carrots_left = remaining - eaten
    
    # Return the results as a two-element vector
    return [total_eaten, carrots_left]
end

# Examples
println(eat(5, 6, 10)) # Output: [11, 4]
println(eat(4, 8, 9))  # Output: [12, 1]
println(eat(1, 10, 10)) # Output: [11, 0]
println(eat(2, 11, 5))  # Output: [7, 0]
```

You can copy this function into your Julia environment and run the examples to verify that it works as expected.
