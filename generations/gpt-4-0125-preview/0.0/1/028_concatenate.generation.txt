Certainly! Below is the Julia function `concatenate` that takes a vector of strings and concatenates them into a single string.

```julia
"""
    concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String

Concatenate list of strings into a single string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> concatenate(String[])
""

julia> concatenate(["a", "b", "c"])
"abc"
```
"""
function concatenate(xs::Vector{String})::String
    return join(xs)
end
```

This function uses the `join` function from Julia's standard library, which concatenates all elements of the input vector into a single string.
