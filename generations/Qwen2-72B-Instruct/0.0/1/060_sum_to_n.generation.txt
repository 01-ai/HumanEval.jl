Here is a Julia function that implements the `sum_to_n` functionality as described in the docstring:

```julia
function sum_to_n(n::Int)::Int
    return n * (n + 1) รท 2
end
```

This function uses the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. In Julia, the division operator `รท` performs integer division, which is necessary to ensure that the return type is `Int` as specified in the docstring.
