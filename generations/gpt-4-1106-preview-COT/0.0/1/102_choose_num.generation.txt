To implement the `choose_num` function, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if `x` is greater than `y`. If so, return -1 because the range is invalid.
2. Iterate from `y` down to `x` to find the largest even number in the range.
3. Check if the current number is even by using the modulo operator (`%`).
4. If an even number is found, return it.
5. If the loop completes without finding an even number, return -1.

Now, let's write the code for the `choose_num` function:

```julia
function choose_num(x::Int, y::Int)::Int
    # Step 1: Check if the range is valid
    if x > y
        return -1
    end

    # Step 2: Iterate from y down to x to find the largest even number
    for num in y:-1:x
        # Step 3: Check if the current number is even
        if num % 2 == 0
            # Step 4: Return the even number
            return num
        end
    end

    # Step 5: If no even number is found, return -1
    return -1
end
```

This function will correctly return the largest even number in the given range or -1 if no even number exists within the range.
