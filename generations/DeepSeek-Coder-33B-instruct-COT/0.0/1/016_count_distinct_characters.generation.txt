Here is a step-by-step outline of how you can solve this problem:

1. Convert the string to lowercase. This is to ensure that the function treats 'a' and 'A' as the same character.
2. Convert the string to a set. In Julia, a set is a collection of unique elements. By converting the string to a set, we automatically remove any duplicate characters.
3. Return the length of the set. This is the number of distinct characters in the string.

Here is the Julia code that implements this solution:

```julia
function count_distinct_characters(s::String)::Int
    return length(Set(lowercase(s)))
end
```

This function works by first converting the input string to lowercase, then converting it to a set, and finally returning the length of the set. The length of a set is the number of unique elements it contains, which in this case are the distinct characters in the string.
