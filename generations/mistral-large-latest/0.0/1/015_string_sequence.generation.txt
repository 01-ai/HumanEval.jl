Sure, here is the Julia function that meets your requirements:

```julia
function string_sequence(n::Int)::String
    return join(0:n, " ")
end
```

This function uses the `join` function to concatenate the elements of the range `0:n` into a string, with a space as the delimiter. The range `0:n` includes all integers from 0 to `n` inclusive.
