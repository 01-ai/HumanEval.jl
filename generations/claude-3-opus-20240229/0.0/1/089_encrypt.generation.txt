Here's a solution to the problem in Julia:

```julia
function encrypt(s::String)
    encrypted = ""
    for char in s
        if isletter(char)
            shift = (lowercase(char) - 'a' + 2 * 2) % 26
            if isuppercase(char)
                encrypted *= uppercase(Char(shift + 'a'))
            else
                encrypted *= Char(shift + 'a')
            end
        else
            encrypted *= char
        end
    end
    return encrypted
end
```

Explanation:
1. We define the function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as an argument.
2. We initialize an empty string `encrypted` to store the encrypted version of the input string.
3. We iterate over each character `char` in the input string `s`.
4. For each character, we check if it is a letter using the `isletter` function.
   - If the character is a letter, we calculate the shift by subtracting 'a' from the lowercase version of the character, adding 2 multiplied by 2, and taking the modulus with 26. This ensures that the shift wraps around the alphabet.
   - If the original character is uppercase (checked using `isuppercase`), we convert the shifted character back to uppercase using `uppercase` and append it to the `encrypted` string.
   - If the original character is lowercase, we directly append the shifted character to the `encrypted` string.
5. If the character is not a letter, we simply append it to the `encrypted` string without any modification.
6. Finally, we return the `encrypted` string.

The function handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, and it preserves any non-letter characters in the input string.

You can test the function with the examples you provided:

```julia
julia> encrypt("hi")
"lm"

julia> encrypt("asdfghjkl")
"ewhjklnop"

julia> encrypt("gf")
"kj"

julia> encrypt("et")
"ix"
```

The function should work as expected and encrypt the input string by rotating the alphabet based on the specified rule.
