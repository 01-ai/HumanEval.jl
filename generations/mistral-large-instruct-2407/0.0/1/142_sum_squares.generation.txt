 Certainly! Below is the implementation of the `sum_squares` function in Julia based on the provided docstring:

```julia
"""
    sum_squares(xs::Vector{Int})::Int

This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the
function shall square the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 3 and will
cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3.
The function will not change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a
multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum_squares([1, 2, 3])
12

julia> sum_squares(Int[])
0

julia> sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5])
-8
```
"""
function sum_squares(xs::Vector{Int})::Int
    total_sum = 0
    for (index, value) in enumerate(xs)
        if index % 3 == 0
            total_sum += value^2
        elseif index % 4 == 0
            total_sum += value^3
        else
            total_sum += value
        end
    end
    return total_sum
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Signature**: The function `sum_squares` takes a vector of integers `xs` and returns an integer.
2. **Initialization**: A variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the sum of the modified entries.
3. **Loop through the Vector**: The function iterates over the vector using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value of each entry.
4. **Conditional Modification**:
   - If the index is a multiple of 3, the value is squared and added to `total_sum`.
   - If the index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, the value is cubed and added to `total_sum`.
   - Otherwise, the value is added to `total_sum` without modification.
5. **Return the Result**: The function returns the `total_sum` after processing all entries.

This implementation ensures that the function behaves as described in the docstring and handles the examples correctly.
