To implement the `intersperse` function, we will follow these steps:

1. Check if the input `numbers` vector is empty. If it is, return an empty vector immediately.
2. Initialize an empty vector `result` that will store the interspersed numbers.
3. Iterate through the `numbers` vector, adding each element to the `result` vector followed by the `delimeter`.
4. Since we don't want to add the `delimeter` after the last element, we need to handle the last element separately.
5. Return the `result` vector.

Now, let's write the code for the `intersperse` function:

```julia
function intersperse(numbers::Vector{Int}, delimeter::Int)::Vector{Int}
    # Step 1: Check if the input vector is empty
    if isempty(numbers)
        return Int[]
    end
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the result vector
    result = Int[]
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the numbers vector
    for i in 1:length(numbers)-1
        push!(result, numbers[i])
        push!(result, delimeter)
    end
    
    # Step 4: Handle the last element separately
    push!(result, numbers[end])
    
    # Step 5: Return the result vector
    return result
end
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```julia
println(intersperse(Int[], 4)) # Should print Int64[]

println(intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4)) # Should print [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

This function should work as expected based on the provided doc string.
