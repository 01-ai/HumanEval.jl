### Step-by-Step Outline

1. **Initialize Variables**: Create a priority queue to keep track of potential paths. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the current path (as a list of integers) and the current position (row, column) in the grid. Initialize the queue with all possible starting positions and their corresponding values in the grid.

2. **Define Helper Functions**:
   - **`get_neighbors`**: A function to get valid neighboring cells of the current cell. It should ensure that the neighbors are within the bounds of the grid.
   - **`is_valid`**: A function to check if a given cell (row, column) is within the bounds of the grid.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - While the priority queue is not empty, pop the element with the minimum path (lexicographically smallest) from the queue.
   - If the length of the current path is equal to `k`, return this path as it is the lexicographically smallest path of length `k`.
   - Otherwise, for the current cell, get all valid neighbors.
   - For each neighbor, create a new path by appending the neighbor's value to the current path and add this new path along with the neighbor's position to the priority queue.

4. **Return Result**: Once a path of length `k` is found that meets the criteria, return the path.

### Julia Code Implementation

```julia
using DataStructures

function min_path(grid::Vector{Vector{Int}}, k::Int)::Vector{Int}
    N = size(grid, 1)
    pq = PriorityQueue{Tuple{Vector{Int}, Int, Int}, Int}()
    for i in 1:N
        for j in 1:N
            enqueue!(pq, ([grid[i][j]], i, j), grid[i][j])
        end
    end

    function is_valid(x, y)
        return 1 <= x <= N && 1 <= y <= N
    end

    function get_neighbors(x, y)
        neighbors = []
        for (dx, dy) in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if is_valid(nx, ny)
                push!(neighbors, (nx, ny))
            end
        end
        return neighbors
    end

    while !isempty(pq)
        path,
