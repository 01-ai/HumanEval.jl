Here is the Julia function that implements the behavior described in the docstring:
```julia
function truncate_number(number::Float64)::Float64
    return number - floor(number)
end
```
Explanation:

* The `floor` function returns the largest integer less than or equal to the input number.
* By subtracting the integer part from the original number, we are left with the decimal part.

Example usage:
```julia
julia> truncate_number(3.5)
0.5
```
This implementation is concise and efficient, and it matches the behavior described in the docstring. Let me know if you have any further requests!
